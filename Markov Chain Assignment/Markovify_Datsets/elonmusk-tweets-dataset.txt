"Important to note that what happens on Earth’s surface (eg farming) has no meaningful impact on climate change.

Overwhelmingly, the risk of climate change is due to moving billions of tons of carbon from deep underground into the atmosphere.

Over time, if we keep doing this, the chemical makeup of our atmosphere will change enough to induce meaningful climate change."

As soon as the big car companies started advertising electric vehicles, those articles mysteriously disappeared …"

@WhatsupFranks @chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan That would be interesting indeed
"@chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan But it was a mistake to push for so many Covid-19 booster shots (even the initial vaccine shot was overkill on quantity).

There‘s obviously risk of the immune system going out of control when it sees what what you’ve trained it to believe is a serious disease over &amp; over again."
"Accurate summary. Look, I’m prepared to argue in favor of vaccines if you’d like.

Do I think vaccines should be examined closely & mortality risk isn’t substantially reduced in America? Yes.

However, you should definitely take vaccines if traveling to places where that disease is prevalent!

Do I think you should take most vaccines even if you never leave America? Also yes. The benefit may be small, but the risk is much smaller."

But, we should still question medicine, rather than considering it sacred. The entire foundation of science is to question it, thereby coming closer to the truth."
@growing_daniel Still the most effective breath mint afaik
@TheRabbitHole84 @joerogan There is an argument that the negatives of SSRIs outweigh the positives
@GilliRoth @PeterHotez Exactly. Two of my kids are on the spectrum and they got it from me, not vaccines. It was obvious from when they were babies, but thankfully improved to some degree over time.
"First of all, I am generally pro vaccine. I have been vaccinated against pretty much everything, as have my kids.

Second, I think there is tremendous promise in synthetic mRNA. It is like medicine going from analog to digital.

That said, the world obviously went crazy with excess vaccination against “Covid-19”. I have that in quotes, because the RNA sequences changed so much that I called it the virus of Theseus.

So many people I know had serious side effects from the vaccines, including myself. Failure to acknowledge that is a lie.

As for the deaths you claim are due to Covid-19, why is the nation of Sweden still alive!? 🤔

Just go on Rogan and do the debate."
"In all seriousness, I agree that we should make elaborate tax-avoidance schemes illegal, but acting upon that would upset a lot of donors, so we will see words, but no action.

Those who will actually be forced to carry the burden of excess government spending are lower to middle income wage earners, as they cannot escape payroll tax."

"@FlynnVIN10 @pmarca Good question.

We are already cyborgs. Our memory is overwhelmingly outsourced to computers – they remember everything with extreme precision down to the pixel.

Our thinking is much less outsourced, as there are still many things we can do that AI cannot. For now."
@pmarca Any downsides?

"@WSJ If @AlexanderSoros is serious about freedom of speech, then we have common ground.

But destroying public safety by electing DAs who won’t prosecute violent criminals needs to stop."
@WallStreetSilv Good point
@alx Just a formality. Alex has been de facto in charge for several years.
@StephenKing There is also equal treatment before the law. Differential prosecution undermines public faith in the justice system.

"This was a mistake by many people at Twitter. It is definitely allowed.

Whether or not you agree with using someone’s preferred pronouns, not doing so is at most rude and certainly breaks no laws.

I should note that I do personally use someone’s preferred pronouns, just as I use someone’s preferred name, simply from the standpoint of good manners.

However, for the same reason, I object to rude behavior, ostracism or threats of violence if the wrong pronoun or name is used."

"In fairness, I must concede that Joel has a good point and I will endeavor to be more thoughtful in the future.

Comic book analogies are obviously imperfect, to say the least. Just because George Soros can bend metal using his mind doesn’t mean he’s Magneto!!

Anyway, my actual concern with Soros is that he has funded so many politicians & DAs who are soft even on violent crime, which has caused great damage to many cities imo.

Also, while I am very much in favor of expanding legal immigration, we must have some vetting of who comes in, so that we do not allow dangerous felons to prey upon innocent Americans."

"Perfectly said. Among other things,  Soros astutely identified a massive arbitrage opportunity in district attorney elections, where a relatively small amount of money has outsized influence.

Soros’s instructions to his pet prosecutors were (essentially) to minimize prosecuting even violent criminals.

"I grew up in a lower, transitioning to upper, middle income situation, but did not have a happy childhood. Haven’t inherited anything ever from anyone, nor has anyone given me a large financial gift.

My father created a small electrical/mechanical engineering company that was successful for 20 to 30 years, but it fell on hard times. He has been essentially bankrupt for about 25 years, requiring financial support from my brother and me.

That said, he does deserve credit for teaching me the fundamentals of physics, engineering and construction, which is more valuable than money, but did not support me financially after high school in any meaningful way.

Our condition of providing him financial support was that he not engage in bad behavior. Unfortunately, he nonetheless did. There are young children involved, so we continued to provide financial support for their well-being.

Regarding the so-called “emerald mine”, there is no objective evidence whatsoever that this mine ever existed. He told me that he owned a share in a mine in Zambia, and I believed him for a while, but nobody has ever seen the mine, nor are there any records of its existence.

If this mine was real, he would not require financial support from my brother and me."

@alx @bennyjohnson Some version of them both is inevitable
"The Swedish study says “sex-reassigned transsexual persons of both genders had approximately a three times higher risk of all-cause mortality than controls”.

If we take as given that the other study 2-3X suicide rate is correct, then doing surgery or chemical sterilization on minors gains nothing in reduced mortality.

My position is simply that we should wait until an individual is mature enough to make their own decisions before other adults make permanent, serious physical changes to them.

The counter to my position would be that if we don’t make the changes when they’re a minor, they may never reach adulthood due to suicide. However, that counterargument does not hold water if mortality is essentially unchanged, which it is.

Btw, I regard cisgender as a slur."

@zerohedge Age limit for sterilization by the state or parents too? Or is that too much to hope for.

After first year, iOS & Android fees drop to 15% and we will add a small amount on top of that, depending on volume.

We will also help promote your work. Our goal is to maximize creator prosperity.

At any point, you can leave our platform and take your work with you. Easy in, easy out."

"It’s super easy to get Fentanyl *right now*. People buy it in open air drug markets in SF and take it right in front of you in broad daylight! They don’t even try to hide. I see this almost every time I drive to Twitter.

Just as with alcohol prohibition, people didn’t actually stop drinking, but they did start drinking badly made alcohol (Moonshine), which could be poisonous, depending on how it was made and what contaminants were present.

The strength of Fentanyl means that even a small dosage increase can be fatal. People are rarely trying to commit suicide, but they can easily inadvertently take too much. Therefore, it seems likely to me that pharma-grade quality and precise dosage will dramatically reduce deaths.

A limited time and location test of this policy is worth trying, as our current approach is failing badly."

@KanekoaTheGreat 2003 is an old survey, so Russian doesn’t dominate as much then as in 2012, but the point remains valid
"@KanekoaTheGreat Almost no one among the cognoscenti even knows this.

Why does our western press insist on pushing such a lopsided view of the conflict?

They must either think that the public is too dumb to understand nuance or the press themselves lack a deep understanding."

@cb_doge 🤣🤣
@LordTJCrypto Nice
"An advantage of having organizational affiliation on this platform is that you can change your name without losing verification.

More importantly, it helps greatly with reducing impersonation fraud."
"I think we should legalize it. The probability of overdose or a bad batch is greatly reduced if there is actual QA & regulation.

Also, crime flourishes when substances are made illegal. Alcohol is very much a “drug” – it’s just a legacy drug from olden times when we had no technology!

Prohibition of alcohol in the United States caused the greatest increase in organized crime in our history. How many times do we have to learn this lesson!?"

Yes, non-advertising revenue sources are important, so that this platform is not overly reliant on the whims of corporate America, but having a large number of verified accounts will also clean up the system.

A single desktop computer can create thousands of fake accounts for <1/10th of a penny and the latest AI can get past any “are you human?” checks.

The choices are either move to a verified system or social media becomes a bot/troll hellscape like FB."
@zerohedge This is a serious risk
@BillyM2k Yay ♥️♥️♥️ !!!
"In the coming weeks, Twitter will prioritize replies by:

1. People you follow
2. Verified accounts
3. Unverified accounts

Verified accounts are 1000X harder to game by bot &amp; troll armies.

"Ralph Nader, you are lying – shame on you! I personally provided almost all Tesla funding, based on my proceeds from PayPal, from Series A in 2004 until Series C in 2007.

In late 2008, I gave Tesla the last money I had. It was that or the company would have died. We closed that funding round at 6pm on Christmas Eve.

If we had not closed that round, Tesla would have gone bankrupt 2 days after Christmas. I gave my last money thinking Tesla would probably still die, not thinking that it would be lucrative.

The first meaningful government funding Tesla received was in Q2 2010 from a loan under the vehicle efficiency lending program. Tesla paid back that loan early with interest. Taxpayers actually made a profit.

"You are not alone. When I ask people if they use Twitter, almost all have for many years. When I ask if they’ve ever bought something from an ad after using the site for a decade, the answer is almost always no. That’s insane!

The biggest problem is that Twitter optimized for impressions over clicks, with the perverse result that it *maximized* ad irrelevance, because clicking on an ad takes you away from Twitter, thus reducing impressions generated per user-minute. 🤯🤯

The sheer madness of this takes a moment to appreciate."

"Several major media sources incorrectly reported that my Tweets were boosted above normal levels earlier this week.

@paulg Absolutely. Twitter is also a competitor to legacy media for news, so they are fundamentally conflicted.
@romanyam 🤣
@dogeofficialceo @StationCDRKelly Exactly
"@StationCDRKelly You’re smart enough not to swallow media &amp; other propaganda bs.

Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed.

But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3."
@farzyness Exactly. This will greatly increase public awareness that a Tesla can drive itself (supervised for now).

@BillyM2k The giant block lists are problematic. They mess up the recommendation system &amp; create a DDoS vector.
@TitterTakeover We will transition to using only paid Blue Verified for signals, as otherwise too vulnerable to bot/troll manipulation
@LeahLamarr 🤣
@MarcusHouse Anecdotally, it wasn’t as loud as expected
@cb_doge Yes. Advertising also needs to be semantic keyword-based, so it’s contextually relevant. Amazingly, ads shown when doing twitter searches don’t consider the search words! We’re changing that as fast as possible.
[Oversized font &amp; undersized paragraph spacing will be fixed this week]
"Long day at Twitter HQ with eng team

Two significant problems mostly addressed:

1. Fanout service for Following feed was getting overloaded when I tweeted, resulting in up to 95% of my tweets not getting delivered at all. Following is now pulling from search (aka Earlybird). When Fanout crashed, it would also destroy anyone else’s tweets in queue.

2. Recommendation algorithm was using absolute block count, rather than percentile block count, causing accounts with many followers to be dumped, even if blocks were only 0.1% of followers. Also, it’s trivial to bot spam accounts with blocks."

To be eligible, the account must be a subscriber to Twitter Blue Verified
Starting today, Twitter will share ad revenue with creators for ads that appear in their reply threads
@mtaibbi Wow

@ShantMM 🤣
@WholeMarsBlog Sucks that I had to sell so much Tesla stock to do so (sigh)
@WholeMarsBlog Me neither
@DriveTeslaca Yeah. Still many small tweaks to make it better (and the side mirrors are removable by owner), but this is very close to production design.
@BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Yuh, that is par for the course
@TitterTakeover Super appreciate support of @NFL &amp; major advertisers &amp; congrats to Twitter team!
@TitterTakeover @Twitter Progress!
"@BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Yeah, free API is being abused badly right now by bot scammers &amp; opinion manipulators. There’s no verification process or cost, so easy to spin up 100k bots to do bad things.

@BillyM2k @christinebarnum What are you playing?

@TheRabbitHole84 Yes, that will be added in an upcoming release. Also, if your tweet is bookmarked, it will be treated as a “quiet like” and increment your likes counter.
"Major Twitter improvement we just released is that you can now bookmark tweets from tweet details page.

"@TitterTakeover Onboarding should have fewer steps, not more, but creating pinned lists should automatically be offered if you swipe past Following.

@cb_doge @ElijahSchaffer If bots are removed from the system, their likes will be removed too. Are you seeing likes from clearly human accounts disappear?
@ElijahSchaffer Are you still finding engagement to be low?
@teslaownersSV The kind words are appreciated
@micsolana @teslaownersSV @SjvTesla One of the bot defenses we implemented was flagging any account responding to tweets faster than humanly possible
@stillgray Good question to ask him
@teslaownersSV @SjvTesla It is very difficult to stop bots &amp; trolls, while not affecting real users. Won’t be perfect either way, but Twitter is far more resilient to fake accounts than it ever has been.
"Twitter is arguably already the least wrong source of truth on the Internet, but we obviously still have a long way to go.

To be clear, I’m not someone who thinks lots of government agencies should be abolished (maybe a few), but we should always question our institutions, as this strengthens the bedrock of democracy.

"@alx Will be interesting to see how the Biden administration reacts to this.

@ggreenwald @megynkelly Very true

"@ScottAdamsSays I don’t think we should divide issues semi-randomly into “left” and “right” tribes, as it inhibits critical thinking.

@SenatorTester @SenatorSinema But shouldn’t there be some funding in this bill to secure US borders, given that we are spending tens of billions to secure the borders of other countries?
@ggreenwald Exactly
@CramerTracker We shall see …
@Plinz 🧐
Is this true, @SenatorSinema and @SenatorTester?
"Twitter is rolling out View Count, so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen! This is normal for video.

Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don’t tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions."
@iheartmindy What utter insanity that tens of billions are being spent for border security of other countries, but none for ours!!

Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won’t happen again.
@BillyM2k Paul’s account will be restored shortly
@TheQuartering @levie Policy will be adjusted to suspending accounts only when that account’s *primary* purpose is promotion of competitors, which essentially falls under the no spam rule
@TheQuartering @levie Ok, that seems reasonable
@levie What do you think should be the policy?
@RobertKennedyJr @hodgetwins Precisely
@TrungTPhan @stillgray Casually sharing occasional links is fine, but no more relentless advertising of competitors for free, which is absurd in the extreme
@stillgray Exactly. Twitter should be easy to use, but no more relentless free advertising of competitors. No traditional publisher allows this and neither will Twitter.

@neontaster Wikipedia is overly controlled by mainstream media @jimmy_wales
@yashar If a group of accounts engages in “brigading”, the entire group of accounts will get a credibility score of zero, so their actions will be ineffective
@stillgray If an account engages in large-scale blocking, the value of a block signal from that account will trend to zero
@wrvb3 @michaelmalice A two day suspension of maybe 7 accounts for doxxing got an actual Wikipedia page!? Wikipedia is controlled by the MSM journalists. Can’t trust that site anymore.

@alx So they’re saying  it’s really bad to suspend people from Twitter 🤔
@WholeMarsBlog https://t.co/biqA7UUoL6
@TweetBinder @jason_kint Woohoo 🔥🔥🔥
@jason_kint 😱
@CommunityNotes Community Notes expands!
@WholeMarsBlog Agreed
@AlecStapp @kimbal Absolutely
@stillgray 🔥🔥
@AOC You first lol
@DavidSacks Seems fine to me
@conmomma Exactly
@onionweigher 🤣
Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
Sorry, too many options. Will redo poll.
If anyone posted real-time locations &amp; addresses of NYT reporters, FBI would be investigating, there’d be hearings on Capitol Hill &amp; Biden would give speeches about end of democracy!
Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
@pmarca Words to live by
"@alx @IFNY2775 @micsolana @JxckSweeney @ElonJet Yeah, we will add that feature. Current system isn’t clear.

A time delay on reporting location that doesn’t put people at serious risk of being killed is fine."
@TRHLofficial @IFNY2775 @micsolana 🤣🤣
@IFNY2775 @micsolana Accounts engaged in doxxing receive a temporary 7 day suspension
@RAMansour @KeithOlbermann 7 day suspension for doxxing. Some time away from Twitter is good for the soul …
@micsolana They posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service
I love Barbara Streisand lol
@IFNY2775 @micsolana Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not
@micsolana Same doxxing rules apply to “journalists” as to everyone else
@Caitlyn_Jenner Yup, recent events make that super clear!
@ashleevance @JeffBezos lol
@ilyasut 🤣🔥
@MuskUniversity So few understand this
@stillgray @MrAndyNgo Twitter obviously must be fair to all, so will aim to stop violent extremism being promoted by any group
@MrAndyNgo Insane
@Teslaconomics Suggestions are welcome
@TheBabylonBee 🤣🔥
@jhall Yeah
Anyone recognize this person or car? https://t.co/2U0Eyx7iwl
"Last night, car carrying lil X in LA was followed by crazy stalker (thinking it was me), who later blocked car from moving &amp; climbed onto hood.

Legal action is being taken against Sweeney &amp; organizations who supported harm to my family."
"Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.

Posting locations someone traveled to on a slightly delayed basis isn’t a safety problem, so is ok."
@mysteriouskat @jhall Yes
@jhall Real-time posting of someone else’s location violates doxxing policy, but delayed posting of locations are ok
@DirtyTesLa @Jason Up to 7 days for human review
@Jason Advertising revenue next year will be low industry-wide
@Balyx_ He would be welcome
@NorwayMFA @TwitterSupport @jonasgahrstore @AHuitfeldt Sorry!
@AvidHalaby Wow

@America1stLegal @DrJBhattacharya Extremely concerning …
@hodgetwins 🏆
@AndrewLawton Sounds like an attempt to muzzle the voice of the people of Canada
@conexaopolitica @VitalikButerin Twitter may have people on the Brazil team that are strongly politically biased

At risk of stating obvious, beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates
@EMTSLA @HarryStebbings Unregretted user-minutes is the metric that matters most
"🇦🇷🇦🇷 Congrats Argentina!! 🇦🇷🇦🇷
 https://t.co/Ki1Mc4wQub"
@HarryStebbings Main reason is that the Starlink value proposition is “better Internet for less money” for most people in low population density areas, which is compelling no matter how the economy is doing
@elizableu @JeffBezos @washingtonpost Good question

@HarryStebbings Don’t want to jinx it, but SpaceX is positioned to grow strongly, no matter what macroeconomic conditions are like

@PhilHollowayEsq @JohnBrennan Exactly
@GuntherEagleman @heydave7 First one was fine, but the booster knocked me flat for days. Way worse than when I got original C19 and was unvaccinated.
@Erdayastronaut @TwitterBlue Basic Blue will have half the number of ads. We will offer a higher tier with no ads next year.
@johnkrausphotos @TwitterBlue No
@Lukewearechange @AndrewPollackFL Accurate
@BillyM2k Haha totally. High quality bots are fine!
@rupasubramanya @TheFP Exactly
@TRHLofficial @ggreenwald Indeed
@micsolana The wording is mine lol
@micsolana In a few months, we will remove all legacy blue checks. The way in which they were given out was corrupt and nonsensical.
@ggreenwald Seriously, they could just write one article and share it, since they all write exactly the same thing!
@ggreenwald True
@elizableu @andst7 @BrandonDrey @realDailyWire Terrible
@MomAngtrades Prior Twitter management &amp; board lied to make their user numbers seem artificially higher, so turned a blind eye to fake/spam accounts
😛 https://t.co/X8Y1YEuS3C
Under pressure from hundreds of activist employees, Twitter deplatforms Trump, a sitting US President, even though they themselves acknowledge that he didn’t violate the rules:
@BillFOXLA @FoxNews Wow
@CrystalHope1979 @catturd2 Somehow, the nation of Sweden is fine

@MaudMaron @StationCDRKelly Perfectly said
@teslaownersSV @Gfilche Number 1
@Lukewearechange Exactly
@dvorahfr @hodgetwins Yes
The woke mind virus is either defeated or nothing else matters
@Rainmaker1973 Big rockets are needed to make life multiplanetary!
@robbystarbuck @StationCDRKelly Many battles remain, but, yes, the tide is starting to turn on the mortal threat to civilization that is the woke mind virus
Truth resonates …
@heydave7 Yes
@catturd2 Easy to fool people, but it is almost impossible to convince people that they have been fooled
"@StationCDRKelly I strongly disagree. Forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone.

As for Fauci, he lied to Congress and funded gain-of-function research that killed millions of people. Not awesome imo."
"@KariLake Reasonable criticism of elections and judicial challenges are, of course, lawful. That seems to be the case here.

Clear incitement to violence will result in suspension and significant deception should result in a @CommunityNotes correction."

@BillyM2k Mostly
Cool, the bots are so far unable to swarm to the top of my replies!
@Gfilche Must be done for the future of civilization, without which nothing matters
"Calling all 🤖&amp; 🧌

@thevivafrei @RitchieTorres Correct

@saylor That’s my guess: small number of humans with large bot/troll armies. We are shutting down IP addresses of known bad actors today. Should have been done long ago.

@sparklingruby Worth a read
"@ZacksJerryRig Do I think Trump would have lost anyway? Yes. And, as a reminder, I supported Biden, Hilary and Obama.

Nonetheless, election interference by social media companies obviously undermines the public’s faith in democracy and is wrong."
@TomFitton @Twitter @realDonaldTrump Unequivocally true. The evidence is clear and voluminous.
@ggreenwald With rare exception, the FBI seems to want to do the right thing, but there is no question that Twitter operated as a Democratic Party activist machine
"The Twitter Files, Part 3

Deplatforming the President"
@laralogan Indeed. Shame on them!
@ellagirwin @jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley Correct
@realGeorgeHotz More than just a polycule in the Bahamas, that’s for sure!
@elizableu Exactly correct.
@CathieDWood Absolutely
@jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley @ellagirwin At the same time, Ned was spending millions of dollars on Warriors seats. Super messed up priorities.
@cb_doge @MomAngtrades Just a rough guess, but things probably start looking better in Q2 2024
@sourpatchlyds @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley Small world
"@jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley No, it is not.

When Ella Irwin, who now runs Trust &amp; Safety, joined Twitter earlier this year, almost no one was working on child safety.

She raised this with Ned &amp; Parag, but they rejected her staffing request.

I made it top priority immediately.

@liquidsunlabs Agreed

@nichegamer @eltonofficial It’s true that most celebrities don’t write their own posts. More should. Way better to hear directly from them.
Something I always admired about American legislators, at least historically, was that they would sometimes vote against the party line
Good for @SenatorSinema! I hope more of our elected leaders act independently, aka in the interests of the people.
@micsolana Absolutely! The real CEO was the head of “Trust &amp; Safety”.
"@Jason @aoscott Top Gun Maverick was great!

NYTimes has gone “full woke”."
@WholeMarsBlog In reality, Twitter is doing a much better job of combating disinformation. @CommunityNotes is a big part of that.
@eltonofficial I love your music. Hope you come back. Is there any misinformation in particular that you’re concerned about?
@Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley It is a crime that they refused to take action on child exploitation for years!

@DavidSacks As @bariweiss clearly describes, the rules were enforced against the right, but not against the left
@ErikGroset @AmandaMilius Really?
@MaajidNawaz @gordonmacmillan No
@AmandaMilius Twitter isn’t using Perkins Coie. No company should use them until they make amends for Sussman’s attempt to corrupt a Presidential election.
@BillyM2k @DavidSacks The far right and the far left will splinter off Twitter to irrelevant echo chambers
@BillyM2k @DavidSacks Agreed
@Jason @DavidSacks While subtle, if you look closely at this chart, you might notice a slight bias: https://t.co/QAC0GexiNz
"@Jason @DavidSacks Most engineers don’t feel strongly about politics, but do want to work with other great engineers.

Silicon Valley has world’s best engineering talent, but is co-located with San Francisco, which is far left.

Thus, far left gained control of an incredibly powerful info weapon."
@stillgray @MarinaMedvin 💯
Twitter is working on a software update that will show your true account status, so you know clearly if you’ve been shadowbanned, the reason why and how to appeal

"@SawyerMerritt Important to note that this is *total* bandwidth within a cell, so would be divided among all phones.

Not counting those behind the “see more replies” aka probable spam button
"Major Twitter system improvements were implemented this week to drop hammer hard on spam/scam accounts.

"Twitter is now serving almost 90 billion tweet impressions per day!

Just how incredibly alive the system actually is will become obvious as we show view count on all tweets."
@EvaFoxU @nytimes 🤣🤣
@BillyM2k Agreed
There are about 500M tweets per day &amp; billions of impressions, so hate speech impressions are &lt;0.1% of what’s seen on Twitter!
@nytimes Utterly false
@Ravii_kc We will publish stats on Love Speech too, as it is vastly higher than Hate Speech!
"Hate speech impressions (# of times tweet was viewed) continue to decline, despite significant user growth!

@TwitterSafety will publish data weekly.

Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom of reach. Negativity should &amp; will get less reach than positivity. https://t.co/36zl29rCSM"
@Kristennetten Please report accounts doing so. Repeated harassment falls into the spam category, so will result in a temp suspension.
@kylenabecker That resulted in a major spike. Twitter will be publishing actual “hate speech” (same list company has always used) impressions later today &amp; every week going forward.
@BillyM2k The (currently) quiet majority should tweet more!

@TheeAleexJ @kanyewest I tried my best. Despite that, he again violated our rule against incitement to violence. Account will be suspended.
@kanyewest This is not
@kanyewest That is fine

@JamieHutchens4 How many views do your tweets get?
"@yvanleterrible2 We aren’t doing well at surfacing tweets from less prominent handles, as it’s almost impossible to distinguish between authentic humans vs bots/trolls.

This is why $8/month with phone and optional ID verification, as well as organizational affiliation, is so important."
AI is getting really good
@dcherring @araghougassian @Spooks Exactly. That’s why I’m encouraging people to interact with Twitter more!
@WokeArchive 🤣
"@jordanbpeterson Compared to AI, progress with Neuralink will be slow and easy to assess, as there is large regulatory apparatus approving medical devices.

There is no regulatory oversight of AI, which is a *major* problem. I’ve been calling for AI safety regulation for over a decade!"
@araghougassian @Spooks View count will show how many people actually see tweets, just as is done for videos. You will sometimes have a video view count of 1M with only 20k likes!
"@araghougassian @Spooks The problem is that likes are public, subjecting people to criticism, and “like” is often the wrong description, as you often just think something is interesting or notable, but not likable.

We need to add these critical distinctions."
@Spooks Twitter will start showing view count for all tweets, just as view count is shown for all videos. The system is far more alive than it would seem.
"@Spooks Have you clicked on your tweet analytics (little bar graph)?

Those who read tweets outnumber those who reply/retweet/like tweets by over 1000%."
"I meet so many people who read twitter every day, but almost never tweet.

If I may beg your indulgence, please add your voice to the public dialogue!"
@TrungTPhan 🤣

@SawyerMerritt Congratulations @jimfarley98 @Ford!
Good conversation. Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.

"@EvaFoxU @Reuters Exactly. The obvious reality, as long-time users know, is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections.

Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective, transparent and even-handed."
Update from @Neuralink at 6pm PT
@NorthmanTrader @vincent13031925 Exactly
@vincent13031925 Trend is concerning. Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately. They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.

@TheQuartering I think I have been very specific
@DavidSacks It’s a real problem. Apple and Google effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores.
@cb_doge @stillgray @ezralevant @latimes That one was real too

@TheRabbitHole84 Wow, they don’t sound biased at all!
Did you know Apple puts a secret 30%  tax on everything you buy through their App Store?
Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why
@LBRYcom Secret suppression of free speech by Apple. Customers were never told. What the hell is going on here?
@jake_k Yes
Apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers
@rupasubramanya @bariweiss Here works
Accurate
@techAU Are you suggesting Apple would use its duopolist powers to hurt Tesla?
Who else has Apple censored?

My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far."
@TimRunsHisMouth As a reminder, I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump
@mtaibbi Interesting development
"@TimRunsHisMouth I’m fine with Trump not tweeting. The important thing is that Twitter correct a grave mistake in banning his account, despite no violation of the law or terms of service.

Deplatforming a sitting President undermined public trust in Twitter for half of America."

@marshallk @Esqueer_ Absolutely
"@Esqueer_ Incitement to violence will result in account suspension.

@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul That is a disturbing story and very concerning that Twitter took no action, despite clear violation of ToS. Report in this thread for now.
"@Cryptoking @RBReich All verified individual humans will have same blue check, as boundary of what constitutes “notable” is otherwise too subjective.

Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.

Longer explanation next week."
@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul Incitement to violence will result in account suspension
"@Cryptoking @RBReich Sorry for the delay, we’re tentatively launching Verified on Friday next week.

Gold check for companies, grey check for government, blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates.

Painful, but necessary."
@RBReich Interesting … now pay $8
@stillgray @axios Much Ado About Nothing
@AP But you have piqued my curiosity … who are these “online experts” you speak of?
@AP AP is such an expert in misinformation. Twitter couldn’t hope to compete!
@ThePrashanthCB @viniciuscfp82 Mars plans are still moving forward

@WholeMarsBlog @semaforben Yup
@nichegamer @brandonorselli @semaforben 🤣
@nichegamer @brandonorselli @semaforben That’s why he won’t answer
@semaforben To be direct, the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false SBF ownership of Twitter narrative while effectively being his paid shill.
"@semaforben All public holders of Twitter were allowed to roll their stock into Twitter as a private company, but he did not do so. Your reporting made it falsely sound like he did, when in fact he owns 0%.

@StephenKing Headline: “Stephen King Tweet Causes My Pillow Sales to Skyrocket!” Lmaooo

@David_Ingram @semaforben @semafor No. He may have owned shares in Twitter as a public company, but he certainly does not own shares in Twitter as a private company.
@karaswisher There was a time when you cared about the truth. That is long gone.
"@semaforben @semafor As I said, neither I nor Twitter have taken any investment from SBF/FTX. Your article is a lie.

Now, I’m asking again, how much of you does SBF own?"

@mtaibbi It is tragic how far The New York Times has fallen – basically just boring af far left brainwashing at this point. The boring part is truly unforgivable!
World Cup starts soon! Follow on Twitter for best coverage by far.

@MomAngtrades 🤣
134M people have seen this poll
@TrungTPhan Red Bull does work tbh
@BillyM2k @lexfridman Definitely need to improve Twitter’s dopamine/cortisol ratio!
@BillyM2k @waitbutwhy I agree
@micsolana 🤣🤣
The most entertaining outcome is the most likely – my variant on Occam’s Razor
@alexxubyte Twitter search will add feedback loops to improve result rank based on which result you click on &amp; whether you immediately click back (implies wrong result)
"@alexxubyte Notes from last night:
- Maybe deprecate TLS this week, as only needed if Android app &gt;1 year old.
- Home mixer computes Home  ~10X faster than Timeline.
- Ad mixer can greatly improve relevance at cost of lower total ad views. More interesting the ad, more time you look at it."
@ErrolWebber Most accurate would be to require access to phone GPS for location-specific polls
@ErrolWebber Yes
Fascinating to watch Twitter Trump poll!
@Nomad_1x Bot &amp; troll armies might be running out of steam soon. Some interesting lessons to clean up future polls.
@DavidSacks Good question

@Nomad_1x The bot attack is impressive to watch!
Trump poll getting ~1M votes/hour!
@micsolana Can’t tell if this is parody or real
@jack @Lucididy @jordanbpeterson Verification through the payment system plus phones, but allowing pseudonyms is the least bad solution I can think of
@saylor When polls are about a significant question, even those who don’t follow me tend to hear about it. That said, I agree with the idea of an all-user poll. Should also be an all-user by country poll.
@lexfridman Agreed
Vox Populi, Vox Dei

@TheBabylonBee If only there had been a way … 🤣🤣
"Kathie Griffin, Jorden Peterson &amp; Babylon Bee have been reinstated.

"New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.

Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted &amp; demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter.

@MinimalDuck @Tesla Cybertruck is something special that comes along once in a long while
"@heydave7 Current class-action law is actually a massive tax on the American people and desperately needs reform. It is one of the reasons medication is so expensive in the USA.

Somehow, other countries do just fine without class-action law."
@heydave7 The actual attackers in class-action lawsuits are the law firms. They just find someone in the class to be their puppet.
@AutismCapital Ok
@chazman We’re working on something that should rank replies automatically
Twitter is like open-sourcing the news

@wongmjane 😉
@stevenmarkryan My apologies, this will be fixed within a week, two at most
@stillgray @dcherring @nichegamer Agreed. What will matter in the future is how many Verified followers you have.
@teslaownersSV We’ll widen V11 beta before Thanksgiving
@dcherring @nichegamer Hard to say who’s celeb &amp; who isn’t. Being able to sort by follower count &amp; disallowing deliberate impersonation probably solves this.
@nichegamer All unpaid legacy Blue checkmarks will be removed in a few months
@RationalBlonde With new release, changing your verified name will cause loss of checkmark until name is confirmed by Twitter to meet Terms of Service

@MuskUniversity (cue Obama giving himself a medal meme)
@MuskUniversity Exactly
@schrep Server control team knows because they stop working from time to time. That’s why they have the “critical 40” list.
"@schrep True. Server side can (and has been) brute-forced, but that can’t solve weak Internet connections &amp; older phones.

Worth noting that Twitter in India &amp; many other countries is slow even on latest iPhone."
@WholeMarsBlog Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space, so maybe I know slightly more than some guy who wrote code for a website
"@schrep There are ~1200 “microservices” server side, of which ~40 are critical to Twitter working at all, according to server control team.

Trimming down that 1200 number, reducing data usage, serialized trips &amp; simplifying app are all needed to improve speed of use."
"@schrep Twitter is very slow in India, Indonesia &amp; many other countries. This is fact, not “claim”.

10 to 15 secs to refresh homeline tweets is common. Sometimes, it doesn’t work at all, especially on Android phones.

Only question is how much delay is due to bandwidth/latency/app."

@nichegamer @abhiharry726 @sampullara That’s what I said!
@abhiharry726 @sampullara In some parts of the world, refresh takes 30 seconds
@Popeska @sampullara How many serial requests are made by app to refresh timeline?
@sampullara And we will finally stop adding what device a tweet was written on (waste of screen space &amp; compute) below every tweet. Literally no one even knows why we did that …
@sampullara Part of today will be turning off the “microservices” bloatware. Less than 20% are actually needed for Twitter to work!
"@sampullara I was told ~1200 RPCs independently by several engineers at Twitter, which matches # of microservices. The ex-employee is wrong.

Same app in US takes ~2 secs to refresh (too long), but ~20 secs in India, due to bad batching/verbose comms. Actually useful data transferred is low."
@mishaboar @MattWallace888 That is not good
@SeagerKershaw @KoguanLeo @hiromichimizuno This is up to the Tesla board

"@EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd True, the food is great.

The fact that you don’t realize that there are up to 1200 “microservices” being called when someone uses the Twitter app is not great."

"@_hawko False. Twitter spends $13M/year on food service for SF HQ. Badge in records show peak occupancy was 25%, average occupancy below 10%.

@jessica_kirsh @SpaceX @TeslaAIBot @Tesla Cool :)

To be clear, my historical party affiliation has been Independent, with an actual voting history of entirely Democrat until this year
@MattWallace888 @hankgreen True
"@hankgreen Like most people in America, I agree with some of the Democrat and some of the Republican policies, but not all.

However, if executive and legislative branches are dominated by *one* party, then we lose balance of power."
Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side, so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who’s in charge!
"To independent-minded voters:

Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic."
But if Twitter is bird, that’s means … 🤯

@greg16676935420 @jack Birds haven’t been real since 1986 https://t.co/lR6BZj0nwX
@mcuban $8 for all
@stillgray @jack Exactly
@jack Not everything needs to have “bird” in the name! Too many bird groups fighting each internally other at Twitter. Angry Birds.
@jack Birdwatch gives me the creeps
@SarahKSilverman Community Notes aka @birdwatch
@GPrime85 @bennyjohnson @kathygriffin 🤣
@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin For $8
@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin But if she really wants her account back, she can have it
@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin Actually, she was suspended for impersonating a comedian
@stillgray At the end of the day, if Twitter is indeed the most accurate source of information, more people will use it
@jack As judged by the people of Twitter via Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch)
@RationalEtienne @kylegrantham Absolutely
@kylegrantham You represent the problem: journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information. That’s the big lie.
@realpfigueiredo @JosianoPadovani @reportersalles I will look into this
@stevenmarkryan Accurate
My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk
Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That’s our mission.
"@alex_avoigt Twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced.

And these are very early days. As Twitter becomes by far the most reliable source of truth, it will be indispensable."
@BillyM2k @StonksReddit No problem to use a pseudonym. The high-level principle is just that verified users can’t engage in malicious deception.
@dogeofficialceo @EvaFoxU @kylaschwaberow 🤣
@EvaFoxU @kylaschwaberow We are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation, as well as collective use of Verified accounts by a single individual or organization
Widespread verification will democratize journalism &amp; empower the voice of the people
@catturd2 No exceptions
Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
"Previously, we issued a warning before suspension, but now that we are rolling out widespread verification, there will be no warning.

This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue."
@JosianoPadovani @reportersalles What censorship are you referring to?
Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying “parody” will be permanently suspended
@SnazzyQ @CorySteuben @Erdayastronaut @live_munro We can beat that

@BillyM2k @nikitabier We definitely need to incent people to do a lot more interactions on Twitter!
@stephsmithio 🤣
"@Erdayastronaut We can do 42 min chunks at 1080 resolution now for new Blue, so you could break up a longer video. The 42 min limit should be fixed next month.

How does YouTube monetization work &amp; what could Twitter do better?"
@stillgray Absolutely
@Cricprabhu Hopefully, less than a month
@AdamFostermusic Absolutely
@Jorge_Most_ Two weeks
@mahdi Something like that
Followed by creator monetization for all forms of content
Twitter will soon add ability to attach long-form text to tweets, ending absurdity of notepad screenshots
@aaroncohn30 @IGrabill @scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan Couple months
@RenataKonkoly @raaahulpandey @TeslaAIBot True
"@raaahulpandey Great question. Twitter will suspend the account attempting impersonation and keep the money!

@ProfitsTaken So long as pay $8, please be my guest
@SamTwits 🙏
@IGrabill @scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan That is weirdly tricky due to the way Apple handles “subscriptions”. If you subscribed to the old thing, it’s not super smooth to subscribe to the new thing. We’re working on it.
@TerribleMaps 🤣🤣
@WSBChairman @BillyM2k Yup
@MarkRuffalo Hot take: not everything AOC says is 💯 accurate
@scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan This feature is an absolute gamechanger for fighting mis/disinformation at scale
@SirineAti @BillyM2k As soon as we confirm it’s working well in the initial set of countries and we have the translation work done, it will roll out worldwide

"@BillyM2k Far too many legacy “verified” checkmarks were handed out, often arbitrarily, so in reality they are *not* verified. You can buy as many as you want right now with a Google search.

@TomFitton @Twitter @yoyoel @JudicialWatch Twitter will not censor accurate information about anything
"Again, to be crystal clear, Twitter’s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.

In fact, we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms, contrary to what you may read in the press."
Excellent summary of Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety from the head of the team

@ZssBecker Agreed. Working on it.
@hankgreen And therefore Twitter should die?
@stillgray You’re right
"Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.

Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America."

@yoyoel @JGreenblattADL @YaelEisenstat @rashadrobinson @JGo4Justice @normanlschen @DerrickNAACP @TheBushCenter @SindyBenavides Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks

This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators

@ThorstenBasch @spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Russia overrunning Ukraine would destabilize the entire region, perhaps the world
@spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k If Russia faced calamitous defeat in conventional warfare for something as strategically critical as Crimea, the probability of using nuclear weapons is high

@zerohedge Practice makes perfect …
"@RenataKonkoly @EvaFoxU @kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many times by Ukraine.

But what you don’t want to do is give Russia a choice of total, humiliating defeat or nukes – then the probability of them using nukes is high."
"@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Obviously many disagree with this logic, but what do they think is their probability of being wrong about WW3.

If they say 0%, they are utterly dangerous fools."
@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 But, hey, look on the bright side! At least Russia doesn’t get Crimea in that scenario, so you can be comforted by that thought, while watching the mushroom clouds rise.
@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO, they will use nukes, then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over
"@spideycyp_155 Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia.

Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base.

From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii &amp; Pearl Harbor."
@hyiki22 @spideycyp_155 Exactly
"@spideycyp_155 If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.

We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose?

If we nuke Russia back, they will nuke us and then we have WW3."

@RaheemKassam The hilarious thing is you’re not wrong 🤣
@EvaFoxU So it goes …
@gainzy222 Fate loves irony
@DavidSacks Even so, we should still do good deeds
The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money &amp; other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free
@Brian_J_Berger That dude is not just a “condition of anonymity” spineless coward, he’s also an ignorant fool. Starlink was directly requested by the Ukraine government, as it was the only thing that worked.
@spideycyp_155 @PPathole @ashleevance It has required a lot of our resources. Going into super lockdown mode slows down new development progress, as we have to resist attacks from a sophisticated adversary actively at war.
@ashleevance DoD provided about 3% of the Falcon 1 development cost. Appreciated, certainly, but should be seen in context.
@PPathole @ashleevance Of course. And their signal jamming systems are also getting better.
@ashleevance The amount SpaceX is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite. Ironically, GPS doesn’t work on battlefields, as the signal is easy to jam, but Starlink does.
"@ajtourville Would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on Earth.

In any given year, there is a chance above zero that they will be launched. We are now at the highest risk in 60 years.

https://t.co/hSqNeYHNX1"
@WholeMarsBlog Curses, foiled again!
@rich_teer @ajtourville 😉
@mtaibbi Accurate
"@ajtourville Russia has the ability to destroy USA &amp; Europe utterly with nuclear missiles in less than 30 minutes &amp; vice versa.

A surprising number of people don’t know this.

Of course, it would be MAD to use them, but it is also MAD to be in this situation at all."
@nichegamer This has potential
"@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Internet fiber, phone lines, cell towers &amp; other space-based comms in war areas have been destroyed.

Starlink is all that’s left. For now.

https://t.co/CdjbOWgziz"
@FedorovMykhailo Thank you for clarifying this 💙🇺🇦💛
@StonksReddit @rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Starlink is the primary communications system of the Ukrainian army on the war front. If anyone else wants this job, please be my guest …
"@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms.

Starlink is only comms system still working at warfront – others all dead.

Russia is actively trying to kill Starlink. To safeguard, SpaceX has diverted massive resources towards defense.

Even so, Starlink may still die."

@EvaFoxU @Nobody_Really7 @EvaKBartlett https://t.co/XTWjF4lv9o
@stillgray Are there citizens of nations who are helping Ukraine on this list?
"@ajtourville But surely no reasonable person would launch nuclear war?

The problem with that logic is if we were dealing with reasonable people, we wouldn’t have war in the first place."
@EvaKBartlett Is this list real? What’s the URL?
Yay!!
@Rainmaker1973 People should never fear turbulence. Commercial airliner wings can handle insane amounts of bending.
@mtaibbi The right question to ask
@officejjsmart @MelnykAndrij We’re just following his recommendation 🤷‍♂️
@narutium @SawyerMerritt Falcon can probably get Starlink past breakeven, but Starship is needed to fund Mars
@TeslaOwnersEBay @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Yes
"@spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX In addition to terminals, we have to create, launch, maintain &amp; replenish satellites &amp; ground stations &amp; pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways.

We’ve also had to defend against cyberattacks &amp; jamming, which are getting harder.

Burn is approaching ~$20M/month."
"@SawyerMerritt Also, Starlink is still losing money! It is insanely difficult for a LEO communications constellation to avoid bankruptcy – that was the fate of every company that tried this before.

When asked what the goal of Starlink was at a space conference, I said “not go bankrupt”."
@BogusThought @SawyerMerritt @rfdctr Maybe the 🐈 got their 👅
@spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @rfdctr @SpaceX Very few in Iran so far
"@SawyerMerritt Strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors in space launch &amp; communications, Lockheed &amp; Boeing, who get over $60B …

Wouldn’t be surprised to find this particular individual working there when he retires from DoD. Corruption at its finest."
@SawyerMerritt @rfdctr SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable.

War is the ultimate Supreme Court
@bdquinn @LindseyGrahamSC Kherson and Zaporizhzhia almost certainly do not want to join Russia – annexation of those regions was done to ensure a land bridge and water supply to Crimea
@LindseyGrahamSC Obviously, not everyone who voted for the pro-Russia party wanted to join Russia, but it would also be inaccurate to say that none did.
@LindseyGrahamSC Below is the electoral map of 2012. Blue is the pro-Russia party. https://t.co/YkZ9hipyAV

@BillyM2k @unusual_whales 🤣
@SawyerMerritt Should be noted that Starlink is still far from cash flow positive. All LEO communications constellations to date have gone bankrupt, so any support is super helpful.
@FrenchyRagin @Kasparov63 A small number of terminals were paid for by the govt, vast majority were not. This is just another bs WaPo hit piece.
@ZelenskyyUa I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world.
"@Kasparov63 We gave Starlinks to Ukraine &amp; lost $80M+ in doing so, while putting SpaceX &amp; myself at serious risk of Russian cyberattack.

What have you done besides tweet?"
"@DavidSacks SpaceX’s out of pocket cost to enable &amp; support Starlink in Ukraine is ~$80M so far. Our support for Russia is $0. Obviously, we are pro Ukraine.

@Podolyak_M No, I’m suggesting voting under UN (or pick your most trusted entity or country) supervision
"@RenataKonkoly Russia is doing partial mobilization. They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk. Death on both sides will be devastating.

Russia has &gt;3 times population of Ukraine, so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine, seek peace."
"@RenataKonkoly You are assuming that I wish to be popular. I don’t care.

I do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome."
Let’s try this then: the will of the people who live in the Donbas &amp; Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine
@PopMech Cheese is amazing
@Nemli_mot Indeed. Biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.
@raulsanchezuk The bot attack on this poll is strong!
@AkiKivirinta The will of the people should decide whether they are part of Russia or Ukraine, but Russia invaded areas that would unequivocally choose to be part of Ukraine
Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war
This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then
"Ukraine-Russia Peace:

- Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.

- Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).

- Water supply to Crimea assured.

- Ukraine remains neutral."

"@Andy8671025 @WholeMarsBlog Solar panels, ground mount &amp; rooftop, paired with stationary batteries, will be civilization’s primary source of energy, as sure as day follows night.

"@BLKMDL3 @Apple @SpaceX We’ve had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity. iPhone team is obv super smart.

@austinhinson_ @Tesla Note, I am putting a lot of time personally into advancing Tesla service to make it awesome. Hopefully, this is starting to be felt by Tesla owners.

Spent the day walking entire Giga Berlin production line – team is doing excellent work!
@jonbbc @WholeMarsBlog @aelluswamy 10.69.1 is even better. We reduced latency &amp; jitter in hardware command loop, so time from object detection to brake actuation is 10% to 20% better.

"@RationalEtienne @arctechinc No. Let me make something clear: James contacted me directly to be included in *early* beta, which is only ~1000 cars, mostly employees.

"@chazman @aelluswamy Glad it’s working out! Thanks for giving us this tough case to solve. That’s what field testing is all about.

This early version of 10.69 is being extra cautious, so waits for a moderately big gap in traffic to cross. Upcoming releases will do better in heavy traffic."
@chazman @aelluswamy Just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome Tesla software/AI team is who really deserves the credit. The talent level at Tesla is incredible.
Note, you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app
"After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5th.

Current price will be honored for orders made before Sept 5th, but delivered later."
"FSD Beta 10.69 started rolling out to Tesla owners last night. This build is a big step forward!

10.69.1 probably end of week with wider release.

1069.2 in a few weeks should be good enough to provide to all FSD Beta participants."
@BLKMDL3 @Tesla Tesla Autopilot/AI team did great work with 10.69! Some point releases needed for polish, so 10.69.2 should really shine.
@Teslarati @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @JohnnaCrider1 🤔

@SpaceX @Space_Station About twice as much useful mass to orbit as rest of Earth combined
@tanayj Absolutely
"@Erdayastronaut @LevEakins More accurate word is “propellant”, rather than “fuel”. Starship is ~78% liquid oxygen, ~22% fuel.

Propellant cost is of primary importance for a fully reusable rocket, so reusable rockets want high thrust, as thrust below T/W of 1 is irrelevant."
@Rainmaker1973 I use this example a lot
"@TJ_Cooney @SpaceX Starlink bandwidth varies a lot, depending on user terminal density &amp; time of day. That’s why the long wait in some areas.

Engines themselves &amp; booster base are extremely robust. High strength stainless steel is bulletproof to a handgun at ~2.5mm thickness. Booster dome is 4mm."
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Electric power for booster &amp; ship is needed even when engines aren’t running &amp; incremental power draw of TVC isn’t too bad. We have local supercaps on each engine to deal with power spikes.
"@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Enabling engines to take the heat without shrouds might save over 10 tons, all things considered.

Shrouds are also a risk in that fuel leaks could be contained by the shroud, forming a MOX bomb.

Booster is purging all 33 engine shrouds in flight to prevent this."
"@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 All mass necessitated by an engine design should count as engine mass, eg shrouds, TVC hydraulic power or excess purge gas.

Raptors in production now have electric TVC, saving over a ton of hydraulics mass on booster."

"@S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC This would be a super bad idea, since stocks can swing wildly from one day to the next, eg Snapchat dropping 43%. Tesla is ~40% below ATH!

@teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about Tesla for 15 years. He’s a compelling liar. Fooled me for almost 3 years.
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty They say history is written by the victors, but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive &amp; has lots of time on their hands!
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty When Eberhard was fired unanimously by the board in July 2007 (for damn good reasons), no one left with him. That says it all.
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty If filing a shell corp constitutes “founding a company”, then I’d be the only founder of PayPal, since I filed the original incorporation docs for https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy (later renamed PayPal), but that’s not what founding means.
"@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees, no IP, no designs, no prototype, literally nothing but a biz plan to commercialize AC Propulsion’s Tzero car, which was introduced to me by JB Straubel, *not* Eberhard.

@PPathole @stats_feed We have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction &amp; refinement
@PPathole @stats_feed True
"@stats_feed Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining &amp; refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.

There is no shortage of the element itself, as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth, but pace of extraction/refinement is slow."

We’ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month, then another month to integrate, so hopefully May for orbital flight test."
"@thesheetztweetz @QuiltyAnalytics SpaceX default plan was ~65% of global launch mass to orbit this year. Incremental demand might take that to ~70%, so not a major change. Those numbers don’t count Starship.

Rough math is ~16 tons * 50 launches = 800 tons. Rest of world is &lt;400 tons (mostly China)."

@WholeMarsBlog @moneymik3420 @jack @gdb Yeah, definitely don’t use C unless optimizing for hardware performance!
"@jack @gdb I’m a fan of Rust. Clearly scales well, given that Discord uses it.

For max performance, however, nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer.

Otherwise, we mostly use C++ &amp; Python."
"@Kristennetten While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the “hard one”, in fact they are all difficult &amp; important. Tight C &amp; custom compiler too.

An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability &amp; long life is also critical. Can’t just jam GPUs in the trunk."
@tesletter @Kristennetten Definitely
"@Kristennetten A general solution to self-driving (essentially, real-world AI) requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training, inference, control, analytical tools, data management, hardware optimization &amp; simulation.

One of the hardest technology problems that exists."

@tesla_raj Many UI improvements coming
@CSmithson80 @heydave7 @BLKMDL3 @mims This chart is a big deal
@BLKMDL3 @mims Predicting macroeconomics is challenging, to say the least. My gut feel is maybe around spring or summer 2022, but not later than 2023.
@mims If history is any guide, not many will make it past the next recession

@PPathole I do
@GailAlfarATX @SawyerMerritt Wow, working on this problem has soaked up a lot of my time &amp; brain cycles over the past ~7 years! This and Starship engines are currently the two hardest problems.
@SawyerMerritt Ashok was the first person recruited from my tweet saying that Tesla is starting an Autopilot team!
@esprit_tesla @chazman @lexfridman Yes
@risermaker @engineers_feed ~700nm to ~400nm
@SirineAti @engineers_feed FAA approval is the schedule driver. Their latest update says end of February.
Lex asks great questions
@cleantechnica Most people still have no idea that sustainable energy generation is growing so fast
@SpaceXMR 🤣
"@engineers_feed The resolution of the universe is not smaller than Planck length
https://t.co/hoyZR4d0pP"
@karpathy All of reality can be simulated with ones &amp; zeroes
@lexfridman Yeah, the smarter someone is, the harder it is to simulate/predict their behavior
@BillyM2k Now that the Webb telescope has been launched, they will have to spend more on rendering haha
@BillyM2k It is simulations all the way down, until you get to one bit
@PPathole People are able to break any laws made by humans, but none made by physics
Physics formulas are the rendering rules
So much of AI is about compressing reality to a small vector space, like a video game in reverse
@stats_feed @engineers_feed Useful mass to orbit is what matters

@nichegamer It’s good
@PPathole @Tesla That was a crazy tough year. Tesla financing closed at 6pm Christmas Eve – last hour of the last day possible. Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas.
@cyantist It was a shamefully low blow from WSJ
@WholeMarsBlog And many other things
@davidjkon @Tesmanian_com No, that’s some tool with senior editor privileges who keeps putting that there
@Tesmanian_com “History is written by the victors” except on Wikipedia, as your enemies are still alive &amp; have lots of time on their hands 🤣🤣
@Tesmanian_com My wiki is such a dumpster fire 🤣🤣. That’s how you know it isn’t curated.
@GerberKawasaki A lot will be added
Tesla holiday software update goes to wide release today!
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla is technically a car like an iPhone is technically a phone
10.8 looks good, rolling out today
@BLKMDL3 Good idea
@BillyM2k @jack @gladstein @rahilla @farokh @samkazemian @TheSmarmyBum @ethereum That’s why I’m pro Doge
The @SkepticsGuide book is 👍
"Lots of Tesla cars to deliver before year end! Your support in taking delivery is much appreciated.

Thanks also to the Tesla team working hard during the holidays!"
@scottwww @realrobcopeland Yeah, I didn’t have a house in the Bay Area for over a decade, despite spending half the week there
Whereas radar has trouble seeing small pedestrians, they’re obvious to Tesla vision
@nurodev Disney restricted us to US only
@JeffTutorials Yes, but if we find unexpected bugs, release might be delayed until 24th
@WillFealey Yes
Tesla holiday software release being tested with internal owners today. Broader rollout starts tomorrow evening.
@WholeMarsBlog We’re aiming for a significant improvement for owners outside the US around March, depending on regulatory approvals
@Gfilche It’s a great whistle!
@BillyM2k @daelmor @DanCrenshawTX 💯
@WholeMarsBlog This assumes completion of the 10b sales
@cleantechnica Pure vision, especially when using explicit photon count, is much better than radar+vision, as the latter has too much ambiguity – when radar &amp; vision disagree, it is not clear which one to believe
@nichegamer 🤣
@teslatidbits @WholeMarsBlog @DanCrenshawTX A strong bias towards consumption tax makes sense
@daelmor @BillyM2k @DanCrenshawTX 🤣 People who don’t create products &amp; services don’t realize that it takes hard work to produce products &amp; services
@DanCrenshawTX Agreed. Taxes do need to be collected, but what is the best way to do this that maximizes area under the curve of the happiness of the people?
@harald_murphy @SpaceX @Tesla @Jays200 A lot of improvement still coming just from software updates to satellites &amp; terminals
@Erdayastronaut I talked about Falcon 9 &amp; Heavy for over a decade!
@PPathole Still kinda hard to believe it is working

Tesla FSD 10.8 plus holiday fun software release probably Tuesday
@Space__Biscuit @NASASpaceflight 15 degrees
"@NASASpaceflight Yup. Next booster will have 33 Raptor 2 engines, with 13 steering.

Ship is being upgraded to 9 engines (3 sea-level gimbaling, 6 vacuum fixed) with increased propellant load."
Each Raptor 1 engine above produces 185 metric tons of force. Raptor 2 just started production &amp; will do 230+ tons or over half a million pounds of force.
@CathieDWood Interesting
@heydave7 @JohnnaCrider1 @SenWarren @buckporno The great state of Massachusetts deserves someone better

@Teslarati @ResidentSponge We are
@TstTwet Noooo
@markgurman 🤣
@BabyTesla3 @teslaownersSV @TheRealBuzz Very soon
@OwenSparks_ @teslaownersSV @TheRealBuzz Yeah, when we’re out of beta
@teslaownersSV @TheRealBuzz Most likely
@Liv_Boeree Absolutely
@TheRealBuzz Well-said, Dr Aldrin!
@DirtyTesla @Tesla Yup
@PPathole @thesheetztweetz Well-optimized Starship would do ~250 tons to orbit as expendable &amp; ~150 tons fully reusable
@jhong @sama Nods
@wintonARK The day FSD goes to wide release will be one of the biggest asset value increases in history
@thesheetztweetz Full &amp; rapid reusability is the holy grail of orbital rocketry

@slashdot Autonomy must &amp; will work even with no connectivity
@harrison_astro We can do that partially, but detailed rocket technology is considered advanced weaponry (same tech as nuclear missiles), so there are more limitations than at Tesla
@AnythingTesla @Tesla Yeah
@Lootster @TrungTPhan 👆
@TrungTPhan Maybe Buffett should invest in Tesla haha

@Manic_Marge @Tesla Always
@teslaownersSV @JonErlichman 😜
@coffeetabletsla @alex_avoigt Agreed. Trying to get all the approvals needed to offer insurance is extremely difficult, but it’s coming.
@teslaownersSV Production, supply chain &amp; logistics are so hard!
@SciGuySpace Yeah

@Sofiaan @Tesla Team is in fact working hard! They just confirmed 10.2 is good to go tomorrow night.
@cleantechnica It’s true
@SawyerMerritt @AustinTeslaClub Hell yeah
@PPathole @SpaceX @4thFromOurStar Sure hope so!
@Gfilche Physics ftw
@flcnhvy These are nice, but high time we built a really big Tesla coil!
@WholeMarsBlog Cells &amp; FSD are massive, the rest is just beauty &amp; romance … but life is empty without those last two
@shortword Yeah, headlights are precision LED, so they can be bright without blinding oncoming traffic, pedestrians &amp; cyclists
@truth_tesla It will hopefully achieve sustained cycle time of 45 seconds. At 75% uptime over an average week, that’s ~10k/week if run 24/7.
@teslaownersSV Sunday/Monday
@ErwinLindeman20 Das klingt nach “Space Party”
A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.
Giga Berlin-Brandenburg Spaß-Party heute!
@LifeofMikej @TeslaOwnersBC @DriveTeslaca @Tesla @Teslarati There are many small joys as you explore the car &amp; more to come via software updates

"@jc_comrade Should be nationwide rollout by end of month. Note, still limited by peak number of users in same area.

This will improve as more satellites are launched."
@GerberKawasaki Haha true
@johnkrausphotos Definitely further refinements coming to (early beta) safety test score. It will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability. Exciting actuarial problem!
@lexfridman Sure
"@Teslarati @13ericralph31 It’s a big deal that Dragon is reusable, with improved refurbishment efficiency with each passing flight! This is not the case for other orbital spacecraft.

It means the spacefleet grows every time a new Dragon is made."
@probablyup Long list of mostly little items, but driving experience is significantly better. We will put notable changes in the release notes.
@jgrano305 Everyone with a perfect score with get it. There are ~1000 owners with perfect scores. Maybe 1100 to 1200 by Friday night.
@TeslaClubWI Note, quality of experience can vary dramatically, as our neural nets have far more training data in some parts of the country than others, but this should improve rapidly with more driving in those regions.
@TeslaClubWI Yes
@SahilBloom Try explaining it to a 17-month-old – that’s hard!
"FSD Beta 10.2 rolls out Friday midnight to ~1000 owners with perfect 100/100 safety scores.

Rollouts will hold for several days after that to see how it goes.

If that looks good, beta will gradually begin rolling out to 99 scores &amp; below."

Apologies, 10.2 release will be a week from Friday
@BLKMDL3 First few days probably 100/100, then 99, 98, etc.
Wow, lot of interest in FSD beta! Plan is to roll out version 10.2 midnight Friday, then on-ramp ~1000 owners/day, prioritized by safety rating.
"@Erdayastronaut @LabPadre If tiles are not super thin, you get hot plasma “waterfalling” off edges of tiles, creating hotspots.

@HistoryInPics Tesla is the king of car farts!
@ro_ma_vive @cybrtrkguy Hopefully worldwide long-term, but insurance is a regulatory labyrinth/escape room!
"@cybrtrkguy The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow &amp; complex, varying considerably by state.

Tesla is hoping to offer real-time (based on actual driving history) insurance in Texas next month.

Probably next year before we get approval in New York."
@ElectricRaph @28delayslater @KounisTou Good point, we could enable visualization before control. Will enable that option hopefully next month.
@TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaGong @inspiration4x Definitely upgraded toilets :) We had some challenges with it this flight.
@carsonight Not super surprising, given that internal combustion engine cars literally have “combustion” in the name
@TeslaGong @inspiration4x Yeah, a little oven for heating food &amp; Starlink wifi
Just met with the @Inspiration4x crew in Florida to congratulate them in person. Such great people!
@ray4tesla Tesla has not yet decided on a fourth Gigafactory location

@BryceSpaceTech Still basically nothing compared to the orbital mass flux needed for a base on moon or Mars
@kittynouveau Probably will trap a Tesla with the production Autopilot build, but won’t work with FSD. Using a ring of cones would stop FSD though.
@NevanRead @A11electric It will be there

"@SamTwits @Erdayastronaut @PPathole @vincent13031925 Long chain hydrocarbons, like kerosene, have excellent volumetric energy density, but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen, which is CH4.

@SpaceX ♥️ 🌍 🌎 🌏 ♥️
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @vincent13031925 Fully reusable rockets want high T/W to minimize $/ton to orbit, because propellant cost actually matters
@WholeMarsBlog Automatically drive to most obvious location unless occupant says otherwise

"@WholeMarsBlog @truth_tesla @LimitingThe There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel.

For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.

Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft."
@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Our new cell is 46mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance
"@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Yes.

Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.

Then, pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.

Pretty basic."
Time is the ultimate currency
@long_elon @LimitingThe Iron, the last element made in a star, appears likely to exceed nickel by 3:1 or more
@LimitingThe Generally agree, but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use.

@Teslarati @KlenderJoey I’d recommend they get their first plant working. It’s insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge It’s gonna be awesome
@Erdayastronaut Yup
@wapodavenport However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.
"@wapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.

Without flaps &amp; heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs don’t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights."

Moreover, it must be rapidly &amp; completely reusable (like an airplane). This is the only way to make life multiplanetary.

Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large."
@BBCAmos @NASASpaceflight Ok
"@WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus:

Booster
- Grid fins for aero control
- Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks
- Protecting engines from entry loads

Ship
- Body flaps for aero control
- Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks
- Heat shield"
@Astro_Elliott @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Inevitably
@NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isn’t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V.
@thesheetztweetz It is ~98% done, but the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining

"@DavidNagySFgang @rocketry_catboy Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work, but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not.

"@Gfilche Ships are probably fine with iron cells, but aircraft need very high energy density for good range.

I’m not saying Tesla will do aircraft – we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation – just that max energy density is needed for aircraft."
@DJSnM Indeed
@rich_teer @Tesla We will try. Preferable for Tesla too, as they last so long. Unlike other makers of cars, our goal is *not* to profit from service. Best service is not needing service in the first place.

@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Sure
@Adamklotz_ @PPathole Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport.
"@PPathole Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is!

Body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket.

"@TesLatino @klwtts @jpr007 Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full “parking lot”.

Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full."
"@jpr007 Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range.

@PPathole Yeah
@PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%, due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber
"@Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.

Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms."

"@mrgreyev @DirtyTesla @Tesla When we need strange training examples, eg half a car on highway, Tesla sim delivers.

Also, accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples.

For safety tests, Autopilot sees dummy far away. Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers."
@RenataKonkoly @thesheetztweetz @rookisaacman @johnkrausphotos @wapodavenport @blueorigin But can I pay in Doge?
@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno But I guess I should take my own advice &amp; just work on saving the things I love
@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete, costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition.
"@torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. https://t.co/Abd5sWhZDt

In any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter."
@thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added https://t.co/SJIHA3BLhL
"@Astro_Elliott @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket.

Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload."
@_TomCross_ Million tons to Mars requires R R R
Super Heavy moves tomorrow https://t.co/qHG1SYO46S
"@LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X.

In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V."

@XHNews The economic prosperity that China has achieved is truly amazing, especially in infrastructure! I encourage people to visit and see for themselves.
@Erdayastronaut Impressive
"@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Now, this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts &amp; everyone knows it.

However, in this case, it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary, which is the goal of SpaceX, vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed &amp; Boeing.

Not ok."
@dogeofficialceo @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Yeah, but dogz rūl
"@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement.

If this is not true, then you won’t have a problem removing it.

Your parent company, Lockheed, darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source.

Seems a little inconsistent …"
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@thesheetztweetz Work needed between flights is less &amp; less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero.
@EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements
Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R 🏴‍☠️
@Erdayastronaut We’ve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5.
@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We’re changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships.
@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower.
@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.
@torybruno @Dynetics Should I bring a few spare engines … I mean, just in case.
@torybruno @Dynetics Sure
@PassionFlix @ToscaMusk I liked your movie “Hollywood Dirt”!
"@nextspaceflight There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too.

That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July."
@torybruno @Dynetics When do the engines arrive? 😉
"@SpaceX Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic.

There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken."
@SpaceX Sonic boom incoming https://t.co/jWAyA0j5Xx
"@IIHS_autosafety Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! That’s the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too.

Retesting in a month or so with improved software. The improved software will then be uploaded to all cars with FSD computers."
@smvllstvrs Not bad
@DirtyTesla Production release update coming this week, which includes raising max speed to 80 mph. Sorry, 75 mph limit was done as precautionary measure. Turned out to be unnecessary.
Thanks for all the happy birthday wishes!
@JRossNicoll Important to support

Shout out to the awesome Tesla global team. Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful!
@torybruno Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate.

"@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel).

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."
"@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.

Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator."

@loshan1212 @itsALLrisky For those bad at math 👆, 100X higher transaction volume with 100X lower fees means total fees earned stay same. Low fees &amp; high volume are needed to become currency of Earth.

@long_elon @itsALLrisky Only if Doge can’t do it. Big pain in the neck to create another one.

@WhatsupFranks @danheld I swear Canada FSD beta will be as soon as humanly possible!

Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility
@jack True
@ValaAfshar Very important. Most people don’t know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.
"@annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.

In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc."
"Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised.

Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month.

Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp."
Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.
Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery
"@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid."

"@WholeMarsBlog Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar).

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it.

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind."

Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two
@OwenSparks_ I sure hope so!
@OwenSparks_ Agreed! We’re not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power.

Am donating $20M to Cameron County schools &amp; $10M to City of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. Details to follow next week.
"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2.

Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky."
"Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so!

SpaceX’s hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly."
@CodingMark @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX More like V10.0
"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.

However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact."
"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine.

Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days."
"@SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed.

Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today."
@SpaceX At least the crater is in the right place!
@SpaceX A high production rate solves many ills

Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars."
@TezlaMick @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Yes
"@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has “spare” performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.

Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world."
@WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.
@PPathole I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster

@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they’re already there
@brendan2908 @NASASpaceflight Yes
@josh_bickett @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.
@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky
@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines &amp; immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land

@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
@ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.

@GerberKawasaki They are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water &amp; land. We may need something that’s ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy.

@91demigod No, but maybe one day

@eugenelee3 @engineers_feed Yup
@engineers_feed Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O —&gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time.
@engineers_feed Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but that’s more of a long-term solution.

@teslaownerssv It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! There’s some great AI out there, but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk … ?

@Teslarati @13ericralph31 This is incorrect
@pcgamer But it is visually stunning &amp; playability is good
@pcgamer A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesn’t make sense in the absence of magic. Also, wish there weren’t level-based item limits in a single-player game.
@cleantechnica I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare
@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off.
@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines
@picot_john @CyberpunkGame It’s a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great
@truth_tesla @Tesmanian_com Perhaps slightly more confident, but it’s essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.
@Tesmanian_com Dankeschön Brandenburg und Grünheide!
@Tesmanian_com Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (world’s most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict.
@Dota2funny1 @CyberpunkGame Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great

@RGVaerialphotos It will be real soon
@MarcusHouseGame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.
@bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights
@nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.

@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Major upgrades are slated for SN15
@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.
@thesheetztweetz But that’s why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10
@thesheetztweetz Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance
Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.
@Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
@RationalEtienne @MarcusHouseGame Not yet
@StarshipFairing @MarcusHouseGame Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it’s probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.
@MarcusHouseGame Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip Yes
@PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip We’re still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference.

@ReflexFunds @nickidk4 @pcgamer Dojo/Doge
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it’s mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year
@speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly
"@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do.

What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen."
@parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!
@josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn’t matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.
@flcnhvy @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.
@ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Pretty close. Definitely feel 💯 if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences I’ve ever had.
@LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad
@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don’t blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
@pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it’s less than 1% of the pain.
@Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn’t work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.

@KlotzAdam @PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold. I’ve had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over.
@PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this.
@PPathole @Mario_Livio Both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument
Astronaut launch today!
@Mario_Livio No kids though
@Mario_Livio Hell of a wig collection too
@michaelmina_lab It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
Worth reading this thread if you’re curious about rona testing
@stonkmanup @michaelmina_lab They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it’s high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes “positive”.
@AstroJordy @erujabidi A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.
@michaelmina_lab In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I’m asking the wrong question, what is a better question?
@teslaownerssv Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged.
@erujabidi Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold.

@MrSammy_H @pelagicbird @max_roi @rossy65 Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford 🤣🤣. General public doesn’t realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.
@WhatsupFranks The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you’re probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?
@MrSammy_H @max_roi @rossy65 This a great reference! Worth a read.
Case closed https://t.co/pUYiJcAdD6
Soon https://t.co/mWOpR7W8kk
@PPathole Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note, this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable.
@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.
@PPathole Strange
@ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.
@ryaneshea From https://t.co/42z7vRPB9c https://t.co/XTSukcc3Tl
@dana_e_morgan Sure is
Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What’s the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?
@ClareCraigPath Interesting
@john_beans @DirtyTesla Interesting
What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
"@PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.

False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic: https://t.co/Pv6s71jZQo"
@justpaulinelol @cleantechnica Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.
@cleantechnica Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so “Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid” is an equally correct title. The “rapid antigen test” from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
The carousel turns ever faster
@JoeInGeneral @andrewbogut Yup
@ajtourville Exactly
@JaneidyEve Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
@BLKMDL3 If it’s happening to me, it’s happening to others. I’m getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
@austinbarnard45 Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We’ll have to swap out at least one of the engines.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpacePadreIsle @austinbarnard45 Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
@austinbarnard45 We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it’s going to pop the cork.

@cleantechnica Good explanation. 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle &amp; pedestrian traffic. Frame rate &amp; latency from frame to wheel vector change also important.

@PPathole Another fine day in the simulation …
@Nereide Faraday invented the electric motor, Tesla the (commutator-free, three-phase) AC induction motor, in other words, a useful electric motor
@Nereide Maxwell was amazing. Should have more recognition. Tesla Motors, Inc., was almost called Faraday, as it took until late 2004/2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since 1995.
420 is ten times better than 42

@Chad_Hurley @realDonaldTrump @kanyewest Stop being a chad
@Chad_Hurley @realDonaldTrump @kanyewest Uh … Chad wtf
@TechAmazing Einstein was great, but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried)
@jtrevorchapman Yeah, that will be relatively easy, as so few users out in the ocean
@ICannot_Enough @ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Yes, although I didn’t expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that they’re needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.
@FutureJurvetson @PPathole Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later.
@ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell.
@vincent13031925 @JonErlichman I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt.
@JonErlichman That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didn’t own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.
@josh_bickett @PPathole Yes
@PPathole Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge
@itshamzahkhan As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year.
@thesheetztweetz Right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky &amp; plug in!
@kjell_arne @flcnhvy Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
@enn_nafnlaus @flcnhvy Didn’t realize that was possible. No problem if there’s a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
@flcnhvy As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.
Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week
@LouisWFerreira New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.
@engineers_feed Haha
Very close to actual expected flight!
@Nigel_Lockyer I could not be more excited about the new supercollider! That said, while it is considerably larger, I don’t think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.
@WholeMarsBlog @steezyysosa @AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Sure, maybe in a month or so
@steezyysosa @AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Well, it’s basically a tank from the future that’s road-legal, so yeah
@AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.
@kyzcralotSxaM Yes
Penguin Random House 😴 should change the name to Random Penguin🔥
@austinbarnard45 Sure, although it might be quite a short livestream! Lot can go wrong, but we’ll provide video, warts &amp; all. You will see every frame that we do.
@FNarolles @TGMetsFan98 This is what matters most
@Erdayastronaut @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight We’ve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass
@flcnhvy @RGVaerialphotos https://t.co/HEz9otgJJH
@RGVaerialphotos Lord of the …
@TGMetsFan98 @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.
@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Minor
@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.
@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @TesLatino Every 5 to 10 days
@Kristennetten @teslaownersSV @TesLatino Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
@teslaownersSV @TesLatino We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.
"@TesLatino Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard!

Doing “neural nets” without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they’re doing. Reality is the hardest sim."
@auchenberg Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.
@teslaownersSV This build should be noticeably better with interventions
@RationalEtienne @teslaownersSV @toadmeister Yes
"@teslaownersSV @toadmeister I’ve spent more than half my life in California &amp; love the state. But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem.

Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement."
@toadmeister And … Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct 29 https://t.co/b0LyGOtobI
@TOCNewYorkState True. Also, fewer heart attacks, as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity.
@MalekKhelifi24 @9inety6Prince @engineers_feed Now we’re talking. Also, Stephenson 2-18 is in the constellation Scrotum haha.

"@jgrano305 @flcnhvy To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.

Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.

GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories."
@flcnhvy All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life.
@flcnhvy And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.
@ajtourville Bettern nothin or ur 💰 back!

@HyperChangeTV Tesla team has done great work!
@HyperChangeTV Well, tbh, our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash 😬
@westcoastbill Testing for covid is a license to print money
@arctechinc @Tesla Yes, very helpful. Thanks all beta testers!
@Erdayastronaut Video training &amp; inference is essential for excellent autonomy
@engineers_feed Sigh … there should be a new supersonic jet, this time electric
@WorldAndScience Critical to humanity’s future
@TesLatino Mine is a few days ahead
@EliBurton_ @teslaownersSV Sure, it could be an option in settings
@teslaownersSV Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Sure
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ I’m in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
@austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
@WholeMarsBlog Yup. With beta updates, there’ll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast.
@bart_sanders Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
@SpacePadreIsle Starship is coming together!
Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
@austinbarnard45 There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
@DMC_Ryan Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?
@StephenKing Agreed. Are these performance tires?
@SpaceX Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case.
@flcnhvy Sure
Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday
@TeslaGong @PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human).
@PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Yes
@teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Haha
@Teslarati Dependent on proving high safety
@WholeMarsBlog Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).
@Erdayastronaut Cold gas for now, hot later
@Rubix161 I mean, ya gotta have a tiki bar …
Starship nosecone, high bay &amp; tiki bar https://t.co/9qXYxMMIUj
@IEEEorg …
@Erdayastronaut After it gets to orbit a few times
@Erdayastronaut Got a little melty tbh :)
@Erdayastronaut Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn’t achieve anything, but I’m confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.
"@Erdayastronaut Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.

R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps."
FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should.
Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
@PPathole @toadmeister Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.
@toadmeister Sweden at zero deaths Oct 15 https://t.co/Gy9a20uMmX
@JoshTownsend_96 Yes
@juanjacobs @jwangARK Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description, but yes
@PPathole @flyerandyp @mojosusan Mobi-C has too much mobility, fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha.
@flyerandyp @mojosusan Actually, it’s my neck … https://t.co/2vCoAxsrV3
@flyerandyp @mojosusan Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6, however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely.
@jwangARK Pretty accurate. It’s not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNA/RNA to fix bugs in our code &amp; inform immune system what to attack.
@SamTalksTesla London to Beijing would be cool
@SamTalksTesla Wow, that would be quite a trip!

@AstroJordy @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla For sure
@WholeMarsBlog @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla Maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations.
@Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla We simplified this a lot. It’s basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point, which is way more profound than it sounds.

@bad_at_life @WholeMarsBlog Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but he’s in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy.
@flcnhvy Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It’s just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.
@Teslarati With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it’s right.
@RationalEtienne @28delayslater Thank you, much more accurate haha
@28delayslater This graph appears to be upside down
@Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual.
@TeslaClubIN @cleantechnica Will release order configurator probably in Jan
@cleantechnica Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers.
@shortword @jwangARK The SoC’s sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it’s fairly obvious when one is discordant
@jwangARK Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
"@jwangARK Accurate analysis. Quite a few
ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements."
@PPathole @slashdot !
@OhioTesla @JenDunlap_ @Tesla @CARandDRIVER @teslaownersSV @Teslarati @ElectrekCo Glad Jen is safe!

@Teslarati I don’t think this is accurate
@Tesmanian_com Even if half that amount, it’s still a big deal!
@enn_nafnlaus @electricfuture5 🤣🤣
@MariaBartiromo @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JeffBezos @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don’t count!
@electricfuture5 We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.
@flcnhvy Definitely
@enn_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
@enn_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO.
@enn_nafnlaus When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all.
@Carrenimfa Interesting

@Erdayastronaut I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!
@RationalEtienne @toadmeister Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo.
@toadmeister Sweden was right https://t.co/bzc2lFDjZQ
@Erdayastronaut @PelleBrannvall @flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX There are sensitive elements, but they’re on the inside. Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I’ve posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what I’ve posted doesn’t need to reverse engineer!
@Teslarati Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!
@flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
@Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
@ID_AA_Carmack Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.
@RGVaerialphotos @SpaceX I’m proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha
@SDG2030 @anandmahindra @MetniGeorges @ErikSolheim @berniehollywood Norway leads the world
@NASASpaceflight Passed cryo proof
@johnkrausphotos @SuperclusterHQ @SpaceX 👍
@ajtourville Yeah, it’s not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing, but casting doesn’t work well for complex enclosed volumes &amp; high strength or high temp alloys.

@johnkrausphotos @Patreon @SuperclusterHQ @SpaceX Maybe this should be the flag of Mars
"@TashaARK Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.

It’s already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive."
@RenataKonkoly @franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note
@EVHQ2 @TashaARK Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won’t need to wait for FSD.
@EVHQ2 @TashaARK It should be
@franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close — a tantalizing local maximum — but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
@PicklePunchD @PPathole @TashaARK Yes, we will play sexy snake jazz 🤣
@ZainRaz4 @PPathole @TashaARK Yes
@PPathole @TashaARK Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
@TashaARK Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks.
@akidesir @Kristennetten Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%
@ErcXspace @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang Great render. Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand &amp; ship to booster.

@IheartTesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog döner kebab
@TribeHoh @SpaceX @WAStateCommerce You’re most welcome!
@brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
@alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog That looks tasty!
@tesladri @ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
@ICannot_Enough @WholeMarsBlog Sandy Munro understands engineering
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.
@teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
@ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
@skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
@WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
"@WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system.

Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven."
@AstroJordy @WholeMarsBlog They are
@WholeMarsBlog I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
@PPathole @klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley 7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight. This was a proof test, rather than a burst test. We’ll hopefully fix the leak today &amp; retest.
@klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking
@Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley One of the best shots ever!
@SamTalksTesla @SpaceX Much sooner
@mdcainjr @SpaceX @45thSpaceWing @NASA Great photo!
@DirtyTesla @SpaceX It will soon
@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We’re not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
@alvianchoiri Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year.
4th flight &amp; landing for this booster
5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far.
@cleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe.
@SciGuySpace It’s a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.

@alandail @SpaceX Exactly
@SpaceX We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year!

@tobyliiiiiiiiii @RationalEtienne @SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about 3 weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.
@RationalEtienne @SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
@SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Great
@William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity — needs several more Starlink launches. I’m using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet.
@PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) &amp; more ground stations are deployed. As we’re able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
@RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn’t required for Mars, so 4 is possible
@thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
@WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Yeah
@AdlanBogatyryov @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we’re actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.
@MKBHD It’s next-level

@ErcXspace @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Great render! The circumferential welds &amp; skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
@Model3Owners @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT That’s very hard to do. Have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open? It’s designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic.
@FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT It’s cool &amp; for sure can &amp; should be done, but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind &amp; solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)

@PerezShivam @waEMD @SpaceX Fate loooves irony haha
@waEMD @SpaceX Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no Internet connectivity at all.
@austinbarnard45 True
@teslavibes That’s total market, not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehicles/year probably before 2030, but that requires consistently excellent execution.
@CashMoneyLemon @CathieDWood @skorusARK Total market
@CathieDWood @skorusARK Seven years for sure to 30M+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.
@flcnhvy @CathieDWood Both will do original cars
@CathieDWood We aren’t cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3.
@brian_heide @Tesla What about a heavy duty, paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails?
@Pickenheim @matthew_kerle New version coming soon
@WholeMarsBlog Suppliers. We’re only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. Also, maybe the presentation wasn’t clear that we’ve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard.

@Kristennetten Totally up to you, but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners, that would be cool
@ID_AA_Carmack Completely agree
@Erdayastronaut Yes, the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics.
Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.
@ScottAdamsSays There are times when I feel like I’m living in a Dilbert cartoon
@ArtifactsHub That species has stood the test of time
@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole Mostly 304L, some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also, we’re making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture.
@NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole 8 bar differential in ullage, 9 bar at base due to propellant head. It’s enough. Improvements in work.
@PPathole We just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield &amp; go high Mach.
First flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft

@PPathole @Erdayastronaut There are some practical size constraints too. Can’t be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But, it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice.
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut Doesn’t seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure.

The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Haha
We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
@EvaFoxU Thanks!
@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame We really need better legs for Starship. They’re coming.
@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend.
@Model3Owners Fine, we’ll do it already 😀
@ARKInvest @TashaARK Good analysis, although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature

@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
@samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.
@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world.
@llamaa35079089 @ID_AA_Carmack @Tesla You really want waypoints this much?
@ID_AA_Carmack For Dojo, we’re betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.

@cleantechnica No, but you make some great points. Important to note that iron’s cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem.

@flcnhvy Gary the snail is still winning, but we’re gaining on him/her
Embrace tunnels!
@ValaAfshar Tunnels are the solution to traffic. You can have as many levels as you want. Usable tunnel depth far exceeds tallest buildings, so would work even for New York or Beijing.
@MatthewCable6 @ErcXspace Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We’ll build several ships just to improve the production system.
@ErcXspace Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration.
@teslavibes Couldn’t agree more — major software improvements are already in place to extend its life &amp; more coming

@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog Yes
@brandonbernicky @WholeMarsBlog Releasing private beta in 2 to 4 weeks, public beta (early access owners who opt in) 4 to 6 weeks after that, then all US Tesla owners mid December. Above schedule is contingent upon not encountering major unexpected setbacks.

@tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells https://t.co/z9WlvIjoTw

@cleantechnica But actually nothing. Was surprised to hear they’re across the road. Adding silicon to carbon anode makes sense. We already do.

@OwenSparks_ @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci No
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.
@Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That’s probably faster.
@waitbutwhy Now I want candy
@dauqhx @universal_sci There’s a lot of frozen CO2 &amp; H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. It’s solvable.
@universal_sci Perhaps one day there will be an ocean on the northern part of Mars
@jchybow @jwangARK @wintonARK It’s almost working reliably
@jwangARK @wintonARK Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don’t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.
@jwangARK @wintonARK Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory &amp; super high bandwidth between cores &amp; efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
@tesla_addicted @Erdayastronaut No &amp; not possible at this scale
@Erdayastronaut Orbital launch mount
@NASASpaceflight Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise.
@schristakos @skorusARK Sure
@shortword On it
@coach23life I tried to warn them, but they just dug their own grave twice as fast!
@skorusARK 400 Wh/kg *with* high cycle life, produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. Probably 3 to 4 years.
@NASASpaceflight Starship/Super Heavy, which is ~10X mass of Zenit, will mostly launch from ocean spaceports long-term

@WholeMarsBlog @ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Yes
@DanielleFong @ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Absolutely needs liquid cooling. We’re applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers.
@TeslaTested That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight We will push for ten flights with Starlink
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
@Erdayastronaut @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Mostly for employees, but we’ll support public access whenever it’s safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.
@EvaFoxU @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Absolutely 😃 🏝
@Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight I don’t want be cavalier, but there isn’t an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine.
@cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 I’ve been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though.
@ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Dojo V1.0 isn’t done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
@spacecoast_stve Scorcher VI https://t.co/34O80p1hI6
@antonioetayo @Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang Yes
@Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!
@nextspaceflight Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so you’re roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3
@zubinanary @SpaceIntellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages Yes, it will have huge nuts haha
@Teslarati We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!
@SpaceIntellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages My favorite is one in tension, other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut.

@jwangARK Humans are swiftly becoming a small percentage of total compute
@Erdayastronaut @ProgrammerDude Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons, so they’re actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.
@AdamBlitzer @levie 💨
@justpaulinelol @NASASpaceflight That’s engine SN. We’re building SN8 of the ship.
@NASASpaceflight SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force.
Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding! https://t.co/kVKRWksvaB
@Erdayastronaut Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We’ll do lots of flights.
@C_Bass3d @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger &amp; there’ll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing.
@PPathole @universal_sci This might sting a little …
@PPathole The “early investor” part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I’ve ever worked with and that’s saying something!) for years.

@Erdayastronaut This is what I meant by “4D” https://t.co/xpX7j5SnPy
@Erdayastronaut The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it’s a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks.
Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. It’s a beast! Please consider joining our AI or computer/chip teams if this sounds interesting.
@Teslarati More software improvements coming
@cleantechnica Significant improvements coming to S/X air suspension soon via software update! Will simultaneously improve performance handling &amp; ride comfort &amp; enable user customization of height &amp; damping, geocoded for relevance.
@stoolpresidente H2O, CH4/CO2, N2, iron, nickel, chrome, aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel

@pantsbobsponge @andyjstanton @TimFernholz You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.
@TimFernholz So why is this madness acceptable for Boeing/Lockheed rockets?
@TimFernholz Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once &amp; then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd …
@Tesmanian_com I generally try my best not to be on patents
@TimFernholz Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary &amp; “space power”. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money.
@WholeMarsBlog Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails.
@renarddemoscou @BillGates Sorry to hear this. What can we do to help?

@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height.
@Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.

@flcnhvy @shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Neuralinks are currently meant for mature brains &amp; functionality is lost if removed. Rewiring of neurons is certainly possible, but won’t make up for loss of the Link.
@shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups &amp; restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device.
@Neuro_Skeptic Will show neurons firing in real-time on August 28th. The matrix in the matrix.
@Neuro_Skeptic They don’t fire all at once. Some go several seconds to minutes without firing. Some fire several times per second. Very wide timing distribution.

@stevenbonchev @APompliano Something like that. If politicians could legislate wealth, everyone would be a trillionaire.
These are jammed to gills with special interests earmarks. If we do a stimulus at all, it should just be direct payments to consumers.
@PPathole Pretty much
Goal of government should be to maximize the happiness of the people. Giving each person money allows them to decide what meets their needs, rather than the blunt tool of legislation, which creates self-serving special interests.
As a reminder, I’m in *favor* of universal basic income
Another government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people imo

@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor &amp; will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent
@vicentes @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge
@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA)
@TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S/X to reduce resistive heating. Technically, won’t be quite 1000 mph charging, as X especially is much bigger than 3.

@kimbal We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially “no symptoms”, are false positives.

@SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem.
@tlowdon @daniellevitt22 As you’d expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy.

@kimbal There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none.
@BerniceKing @jack @MichaelDTubbs @AndrewYang Very much agree
@28delayslater @geekwire Good hygiene always makes sense
@ChrisDungeon True
@Garrett_Watts @_TomCross_ @Tesla @Petersen_Museum Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
@geekwire https://t.co/mLh6baqfeT
@geekwire There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.
Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla.

@flcnhvy @Ford Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality &amp; market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion, we need to convert &gt;80% of the global road, sea &amp; air fleet to renewables by 2050.

@TslaCybertruck @jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD
@jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?
@uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
@Flash_Titans Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure.
@TheGledinator @teslaownersSV @mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla Haha Teslas all the way down
@teslaownersSV @mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla Maybe, will look into it. We’d need to emulate a TV.
@mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla We could probably make a fun punch (click) buggy game, with extra points for rare Teslas
@MKBHD Bought based on your review. It’s great!
@cleantechnica The was not to outcompete other companies, but rather to maximize usefulness &amp; rate of progress in the absolute
@cleantechnica For example, we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer, which is not something car companies do
@cleantechnica Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies
@vincent13031925 @teslacn We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering &amp; great feedback from Tesla owners in China!
@aikatchu @Tesla Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app &amp; overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet

@Kristennetten @cleantechnica Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later.
@cleantechnica Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars &amp; bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.

@flcnhvy There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
@Erdayastronaut @russ_parrish We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch &amp; landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.

@VitalVegas Looking likely
@Mad_Maelstrom @Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.
@SciGuySpace Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.
@Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SciGuySpace Yes
@SciGuySpace That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.

@engineers_feed Stonks
lol
@Erdayastronaut @i_gvf @SciGuySpace Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @physorg_com @nature @SciReports True
@olenamuliarchuk @mrkylefield @cleantechnica Battery industry is world champion at bs. “Lithium-ion” doesn’t really mean anything. What matters is cathode &amp; anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great.

@engineers_feed Wow
@thesheetztweetz @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew @AstroBehnken @Astro_Doug @ingallsimages @NASAKennedy ❤️ the laser beam long exposure shots
@nickwijngaards @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it’s 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration …
@John_Gardi @SciGuySpace Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.
Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast https://t.co/axmInA9fZb
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.

@SciGuySpace Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage
@SciGuySpace Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80’s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs.

@Erdayastronaut Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha.
@Erdayastronaut Absolutely
@JimBridenstine @Commercial_Crew @NASA Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible.

@devonwerkharder Capitalism already has many fetters in the form of a plethora of regulatory bodies! I’m definitely against any monopolies/oligopolies where there is a low forcing function for improving customer happiness or an unpriced externality that consumes a common good (eg emissions).

In his 18th Brumaire essay (in which he does make some good points), Marx famously said history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. This is now ironically happening with Marxism.
@CodingMark @ResistMonsters @TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente Exactly
@flcnhvy Tesla makes the safest cars in the world &amp; our factory injury rate is better than industry avg &amp; tracking to be better than any auto plant in North America. We care deeply about safety at a fundamental level.
@flcnhvy SpaceX has 8000 employees in California, Washington, Texas &amp; Florida. Operating this entire time, as we have national security exemption. Zero deaths or serious illnesses.
@flcnhvy Absolutely. Tesla already went through this in China with 7000 employees. Zero fatalities or serious illnesses.
@TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente The statistics stopped being valid when anyone with “covid symptoms”, which is now almost anything, was counted as having covid

@Alex_ADEdge @NASASpaceflight Pretty close. It will look absurdly tall &amp; have a lot more ground support equipment.
@alandail Haggerty actually admitted to NYT that he told his staff to “slow down” Tesla for reasons that had nothing to do with health. Unreal …
@flcnhvy @thehill @GavinNewsom Exactly
@thehill Don’t mislead the public. State said YES, an unelected county official is the problem. Tesla factory in adjacent San Joaquin county is fully operational.
Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.
@ChillMichelle @Tesla Yes, California approved, but an unelected county official illegally overrode. Also, all other auto companies in US are approved to resume. Only Tesla has been singled out. This is super messed up!

@teslaownersSV @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with @AlamedaCounty
@TeslaOwnersEBay @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Yes, already done
@flcnhvy @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Yes
@bradd_libby Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California &amp; second biggest exporter
@KristiRJensen @EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
@EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county.
@SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada.
@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.
@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!

@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%
@OfficialAPoD @joerogan Pain can certainly be turned off, but we’re not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet
@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
@IvanEscobosa @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk That’s harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
@thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Ok
@mayemusk !
@sspencer_smb @flcnhvy It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.
@flcnhvy To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs.
@raytech247 @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.
@Kristennetten @lexfridman @joerogan 🤣🤣
@clairlemon @Quillette A mandatory tracing app would be insane
@AndrewFosterWa1 @KillaSarg @Erdayastronaut @ElonHarith @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight True
@teslaownersSV @vincent13031925 @joerogan Probably makes sense to have a “Details” section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
@vincent13031925 @joerogan Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes 🤣🤣
@Godmiller1 @Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla Would cover latitude of London
@clay_ellis @Tesla Yes
@TesLatino Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms.
@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator
@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla Sure :)
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Way more important than it sounds
@GavinNewsom Yeah!!
@Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.
@Erdayastronaut @ElonHarith @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight SLS makes me feel sad
@WhatsupFranks @NASASpaceflight No, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded
@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine
@ABauerle5 A great mystery of the universe
@NASASpaceflight It’s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @YoavOffek Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life.
@Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid
@Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Yes, converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars! https://t.co/WF9AGgee12
@Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we’ll be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack.
@thirdrowtesla @YoavOffek Turns on city street intersections is the big one

@Kristennetten A little. Will have 31 engines, not 37, no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at 200 ton, but upgrades in the works for 250 ton.
Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokémon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?

@jh_csquared @AlexBrendel2 @Erdayastronaut As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it
@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It’s also because of the Spitfire engine &amp; wizard

@flcnhvy Private beta begins in ~3 months, public beta in ~6 months, starting with high latitudes
In advance of this, please try to hack Starlink &amp; Tesla Mothership!
There are now 420 operational Starlink satellites 🛰 😉
@PPathole @Supernova_Style New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan https://t.co/yYrjwWwixl
@skorusARK Pretty much. We place high value on simulation too, but nothing’s as weird as reality!
@TesLatino @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker @SpaceX It’s made of a special dark foam that’s extremely radio transparent, so as not to affect the phased array antennas. Looks a lot like a car sun visor.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. We’re fixing it now.
@OwenSparks_ @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Yes
@yourfavgas @julia_bergeron @NASASpaceflight Small amount of isopropyl alcohol (cleaning fluid) was trapped in a sensor dead leg &amp; ignited in flight
@julia_bergeron @NASASpaceflight Sure hope so!
@TOGregTO Frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil &amp; gas seems especially so
@TOGregTO Not the greatest use of money
@anime_virus @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker If this launch succeeds, we will have put up 422 satellites …
@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Makes sense
@nichegamer Nice
@jgrano305 @PPathole @Supernova_Style Anything surprising?
@PPathole @Supernova_Style Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
@Supernova_Style No kidding …
@ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Good article

@Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV @NASA SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing &amp; now docking with @Space_Station, which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier, since Starships dock with themselves &amp; will be uncrewed at first.
@RationalEtienne @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Great platform 🤣🤣
@Johnny_Detroit @WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy !!
@teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then Mars
@Peter_J_Beck @thesheetztweetz @ulalaunch @torybruno @SpaceX 10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
@Erdayastronaut I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind.
@WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter.
@InSpaceXItrust @jgrano305 Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
@jgrano305 Probably 3 to 6 months
@flcnhvy Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points https://t.co/5cPQ29wOvu
"@flcnhvy You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.

@bluemoondance74 @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests, as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them, there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster No, as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose.
@bluemoondance74 @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster SN5
@MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster No, oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry

Good progress, but 18 years to launch our first humans is a long time. Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime. https://t.co/IsICexqxtV
@Teslarati Pretty much, although we also sent some Medtronic units, which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up &amp; operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system.
@AngelNDevil2 @S_Padival @fourthrowtesla @TESLAcharts It’s a hard problem, mostly due to esthetics, but it’s the future we should have

“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.
@flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter Sounds about right https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg
@dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
@TJShannon87 @Bob_Wachter I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington
@annerajb @samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
@Bob_Wachter They were, but are they currently?
@samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter Interesting
@Bob_Wachter We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.
@RationalEtienne @PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
@Erdayastronaut @BnOrdhaug @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Sure
@Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.
@KeithMansfield @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck That’s for sure! 😅
@Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit!

@PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla My (again) personal favorite is https://t.co/rM1MqsVsr1
@sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.
"@fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.

@cabral_psyd @sivanithu @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!
@PPathole @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!
@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch
@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.
@Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. https://t.co/2IUnS5DPOg
@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.
@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!
@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!
@thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.
@SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test.
To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop
Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
@brandonbernicky You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern

@Darkellysio @katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea: https://t.co/Aq81q9oMdq
@katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible.

@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre There are redundant pressure control valves. It’s a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you’re doomed anyway, so might as well go all in
We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
@PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.

@flcnhvy @28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low.
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical.

"Hello from the Inside
https://t.co/SV3fWL3bkp"
@microdentist And many doctors are not treating patients, due to fear of giving or receiving C19
@n2179_twit @AbbottNews This sounds great
@AbbottNews Can you do a fast antibody test?
@ScottSaorAlba Yes
Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if you’re immune. Refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind.
@PPathole @VitalVegas Buzzfeed is a mind virus
@VitalVegas Also makes for a great shelter https://t.co/f991AJD2mU
@AlexSafahi @NYCMayor We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them
@kshah07 @yosefontwo @JSellMafia @NYCMayor Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.
@NYCMayor Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when they’re needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues.
@NYCMayor You’re most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.
@thirdrowtesla 🤣🤣
@thirdrowtesla Exactly. Douglas Adams knew what he was talking about.
@PPathole @AlexBerenson @imperialcollege Yes
@FidelCatsro @AlexBerenson .@mayemusk Care to comment?
@teslaownersSV @Teslarati Working on that with Medtronic. Given NY pressing needs, we’re delivering Resmed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight.
@alvianchoiri @utkarshzaveri @fael097 Yes
https://t.co/lzh1uj8QCy
@MartianDays Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation
SN3 https://t.co/bM1wzzd4Zg
@flcnhvy @Tesla Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
@enscand @PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include “estimated illness onset date”. This is a significantly less rigorous standard. https://t.co/Dz2Nio5ddi
@PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
@PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
@flcnhvy @Tesla Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
This meme proves it https://t.co/3CHAzxv6dj

@SamTalksTesla @MikeBloomberg True. @MikeBloomberg, this is  accurate. You believe in journalistic integrity, but if something isn’t done, this will continue.
@steezyysosa @TesLatino @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @MikeBloomberg @Twitter Have let @twitter know
@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla This is messed up @MikeBloomberg
@JBNielsen1985 @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Both
@InSpaceXItrust @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water &amp; just dump it on the ground.
@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly
@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!
@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you’re expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.
@romn8tr @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
@stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter
@ajtourville @Teslarati The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
@Teslarati Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
@justpaulinelol @engineers_feed 🤣🤣
@BocachicaMaria1 Will do
@teslaownersSV @RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page: https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Exactly
@jonkay @Quillette According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.
@engineers_feed Engineering ftw
@flyLAXairport Much appreciated
@PPathole @BBCScienceNews Have you seen more data on HCQ &amp; Z-Pak? Hard to find.
@BBCScienceNews Worrisome
@thirdrowtesla Yup
@JohnnaCrider1 @thirdrowtesla We’ll try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @SalehCU Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
@engineers_feed Nice
@JohnCleese This is great advice
@uwdrwaldorf @Tesla @omead_a @UWMedicine Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
@justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @Tesla We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part.
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Supply chain logistics — getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
@NativeCACV @Tesla @omead_a You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
@benikbeno @CDCgov Panic is always dumb
@Guruleaks1 @benikbeno Italy: “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.”
@CDCgov Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
@Jennerator211 We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 No problem :)
@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
@Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :)
@RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL
@PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive
@PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.
@NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”. https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@friedberg Feels like the plot of Deus Ex https://t.co/R8tmw048JM
@MG42bonesaw A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk
@RenataKonkoly @moskov Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too
@moskov That won’t work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can’t stay open
@EdLudlow Yes, we’re working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won’t be needed
@alandrummond2 Interesting thread
@DOfaquarius @PPathole Thanks 💖
@Cernovich China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
@DOfaquarius @PPathole We’re working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
@flcnhvy Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important.
@RationalEtienne @PPathole https://t.co/eltgA3hrAr
@RationalEtienne @PPathole Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.
@PPathole Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April
@PPathole Yes
No new domestic corona cases in China https://t.co/lGmxRvMyFy
@westcoastbill Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart: https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@NYCMayor @NateSilver538 Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs
@M_Mosseri @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_Astronauts Yes
@DisruptResearch @Jason True
@Jason Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already.
@suhaylabbas @fawadchaudhry We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
@cleantechnica https://t.co/9XVratNhnq
@cleantechnica Some helpful data from Italy https://t.co/3taxq5NXcZ
"@cleantechnica Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New “confirmed” cases, not oft-reported “presumptive positive” is trending to level off over next few weeks &amp; be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China.
https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG"
@cleantechnica 0% chance of anything close
@challengerST @WorldAndScience 🤣🤣
@RiganoESQ @DiderRaoult How does this compare to favipiravir? https://t.co/rM1MqsVsr1
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly, but not obviously, related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isn’t a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Won’t risk non-SpaceX satellites.
@KMastersBarnes @SpaceX Yeah, most reflights ever!
@SciGuySpace Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didn’t affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission.

@fael097 Pretty close. Design is evolving rapidly. Would be great to flatten domes, embed engines &amp; add ~1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. Also, current legs are a bit too small.
"Hydroxychloroquine probably better
https://t.co/FWn2kh1LZx https://t.co/wQODHiFeWT"

That said, danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo. If we over-allocate medical resources to corona, it will come at expense of treating other illnesses. Track graph at bottom of this page: https://t.co/7nWKjiZyFn

@Sofiaan @RenataKonkoly @meckimac Yeah https://t.co/yp3pBn4prV
@RenataKonkoly @meckimac I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts &amp; sent me to ICU immediately. I was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. So, I take expert advice with a grain of salt …
@meckimac Was also given a lot of doxycycline https://t.co/hn0BzsIatz
@Gundament Maybe helpful
@meckimac Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest &amp; both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would’ve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn’t mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing.
Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19 https://t.co/LEYob7Jofr

@mrebuzz https://t.co/DjlSRQi4nI
@nypost He studied the blade
@EvaFoxU Memes are powerful
@PPathole @FxzzOnTheBeat Ships with a lot of people &amp; limited medical facilities are a serious issue
@lexfridman Yeah, that’s a great one
@FxzzOnTheBeat Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!
@FxzzOnTheBeat Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!
@War_Remains @HardcoreHistory Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality.
@cosmicdatabase Yeah
Accurate
Envelope expanded
@Alejandro_DebH Recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. If this (land) landing fails, it will most likely be for a different reason.

@Erdayastronaut @Sofiaan @Tesla Cool, we’re tracking to release more FSD features later this month
@Sofiaan @Tesla True. Oddly, those who complained didn’t actually order FSD. Perhaps they weren’t aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery.
Mad respect for the makers of things
@Teslarati No matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated.

@RationalEtienne @Bryr32 Full disclosure, I’m actually a 3000 year old vampire. It’s such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!

@Erdayastronaut @Teslarati It’s slightly better
@nichegamer Definitely worth trying imo
@Teslarati Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights.
@Teslarati Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Science has gone too far https://t.co/Ky65Q3s3JX
🔭 https://t.co/6HHgR0ZVp0
@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
@PPathole @JohnHanzl It’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.
@JohnHanzl Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.
@JohnHanzl LOX
@SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
@SciGuySpace Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
@flcnhvy @sydney_ev Probably

@pentaquarky @Erdayastronaut The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.

@jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +
@DMC_Ryan @Jason There’s a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant.
@PPathole Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
@PPathole Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months

Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
@brittanygayle98 Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home
@dafuq_mac Coming hopefully later this year
@TarunBhatt161 I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
@_mantis_ Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.
@_mantis_ Ok
@G_d_Photographr Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.
@yourfavgas Probably 6 months or so. 301 is certainly fine for orbit, but SpaceX 30X will be better.

@SamTalksTesla Your comment above: “Who in their right mind would buy an ICE after 2025 knowing its residual value will be zilch? Legacy auto: go EV or go BUST!” is super important for car buyers. Residual values for gas/diesel cars will plummet in coming years.

@JaneidyEve You’re welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.
@nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
@chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area
@Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume.
@Teslarati This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.
SpaceX started with a mariachi band party. Great vibes here in Boca Chica, Texas!

@reto_siegrist @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla Yes
🔥🔥🔥
@CathieDWood @sbarnettARK @jwangARK @ARKInvest First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.
@flcnhvy @Tesla @thirdrowtesla Ok sure 😀 Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
Nothing medically dangerous, but 5g is getting a bit too greedy with their spectrum land grab
@TeslaGong @indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities I’m unaware of
@indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature
@TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don’t want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.
@DOfaquarius @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. It’s *awesome*.
@ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Probably this summer
@ajtourville @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better.
@PPathole PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test.
@CathieDWood @ARKInvest The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks.
@TheReal_Psyche Sorry!
@SamTalksTesla A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
@John_Gardi Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency
Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin
Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later.
Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets
Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with

@PRANSHUAGARWA13 @Erdayastronaut Yes
@Erdayastronaut That’s the goal
@Erdayastronaut Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
@Erdayastronaut Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit
Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
@fighteer1 @LCS_Big_Mike @SciGuySpace That’s about right
@g33st111 Reaction to Cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to September
@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.
@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed
@SciGuySpace Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy.
@SciGuySpace Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!

We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun.

@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Yes
@RQuiddich Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.

@SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.
@Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor
@teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah
@Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.
@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.
@DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome.
Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣 https://t.co/qTN2TU02pb
@donnyraywoody @flcnhvy @kulpability @NASA Haha true
@flcnhvy muffin or not-muffin
@realRickyReeves @Erdayastronaut @NASA Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship.
@kulpability @NASA New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there
@kulpability @NASA Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months
8 years later, the simulation is mostly real
@vincent13031925 @Tesla @jsrdctz Amazing work by Tesla China team!! ❤️❤️
@28delayslater 🤣🤣
@BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW. It’s tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains.
@BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working?
@teslaownersSV @iam_preethi I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals &amp; taking action of climate, but these are mostly separate moral issues
@EvaFoxU @TeslaHistorian @TeslaOwnersofMA @JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany Nice
@teslaownersSV @iam_preethi Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!
@ingmutw @iam_preethi @Tesla Ok
@iam_preethi I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere &amp; oceans is fundamentally the issue.
@C3LT_Games 😎

@TeslaOwnersofMA @JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany What is the platonic ideal of the perfect candy? Really feels like candy R&amp;D hasn’t improved in ages. Damn candy oligarchs!! [shakes fist at sky]
@JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany Yeah, Boring Bricks 🧱 are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!
@vincent13031925 @boringcompany Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.
@JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.
@ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much
@Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
@cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.
@RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted.
@EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net.
@amargosavalley Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.
@SMZGallagher @Tesla Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard.

@austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @Joe__Wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub &amp; charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day … blacklights, luminescent spray paint &amp; metal junk sculptures.
@kimbal 🖤 you too
@catmonocle69 Sounds like a Marxist with style
@flcnhvy @cyrusposting Exactly
@cyrusposting Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone.
@Joe__Wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford.
@austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?
"@IrinaAntony @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).

My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway."
@tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?
@geofficient Pretty much
@annerajb @justpaulinelol Federal
@justpaulinelol @annerajb Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.
@annerajb Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.
@waitbutwhy @Kurz_Gesagt Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too.
@TheAssassin_95 Yes, but it’s too secret
@Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV @Benioff Hopefully fully operational in 2020
@teslaownersSV @Benioff Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects
@flcnhvy No, he’s still much faster 🐌
These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them.
@teslaownersSV Done by dawn
@Salo4201 That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣
Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic
@JaneidyEve Flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away
@JaneidyEve We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0.
Was up all night with SpaceX team working on Starship tank dome production (most difficult part of primary structure). Dawn arrives … https://t.co/SzyDSYUYOu

@GutGutM3 @jamescharles Ok
@Teslarati Activating engine two …
@KakaroTTo1385 @flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut It is an honor &amp; a privilege to work with so many great engineers
@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware.
@Kristennetten Future feature
Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all.
@Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!
@JeremyGreenlee @mobiledavidd Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home.
@mobiledavidd We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
@Erdayastronaut Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
@Erdayastronaut Most people still don’t know it’s there
Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar
@TesLatino @teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?
"@teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins Merry Christmas 🎄🎁😀
Hope you’re enjoying latest software update!"
@jamescharles Yer welcome son
@teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar, should do work in morning &amp; home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled).
@jamescharles That is odd. Try pressing both scroll wheel buttons to reboot. Have forwarded this to service.

@teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Regarding 2.X to 3 hardware update, that should happen in earnest in Q1. Software feature delta was zero until now, so not much point in doing it before then.
@EV_Stevee @teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Pretty much, although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems sooner, I’d love it. The real constraint is finding great software engineers.
@flcnhvy @cgpgrey @thirdrowtesla Ok sure
@EV_Stevee @teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Sorry for the delay on V2.X! We just couldn’t get it all done in time.
@marialauraadr @teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever
@cgpgrey My wiki is a war zone with a zillion edits. At least it’s obviously not curated! Some day, I should probably write what *my* fictionalized version of reality is 🤣🤣
@RenataKonkoly Yes 🤣♥️
@TechnologicAli Started Zip2 with ~$2k &amp; ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into X/PayPal, rolled proceeds again into SpaceX/Tesla, but these are all companies where I played fundamental founding role. Not right to ask others to put in money if I don’t put in mine.
If Tesla &amp; SpaceX go bankrupt, so will I. As it should be.

@tesletter @teslaownersSV I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
@teslaownersSV MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isn’t needed for full self-driving &amp; cost is ~$2k for limited entertainment improvements.

@RenataKonkoly @mayemusk They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It’s pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars.
@v_g_fischer @mayemusk Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.
@mayemusk Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol.

@teslaownersSV We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17.
@Kristennetten Your Twitter comments are great btw!
@Kristennetten This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs
@Real_John_D @Teslarati @tesla_raj There will be no loss of either
@flcnhvy @Teslarati @tesla_raj That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
@Everman @Teslarati @tesla_raj True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
@Teslarati @tesla_raj We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.

@RenataKonkoly 🤣🤣
@Erdayastronaut Really? Ok sure.
@vicentes Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
@vicentes Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
⚔️ Study the Blade!! ⚔️ https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI
@annerajb @flcnhvy We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods.
@flcnhvy Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press

@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Meaning not fair that Boeing gets so much more for the same thing
@arstechnica @SciGuySpace This doesn’t seem right
@cleantechnica True
@fael097 @davidtrover Semi-infinite
@davidtrover Seems likely. 🧝‍♂️🧝‍♂️ = hipsters.
@flcnhvy @neuralink Right now, trajectory of neuro-silicon symbiosis doesn’t appear to intersect trajectory of AGI. Goal of Neuralink is to raise this probability above 0.0%.
@CroWarrior1978 We fought the Balrog last year
Gentrify Mordor?
@flcnhvy @v_g_fischer @Tesla It was Tacheles
@Matt_B730 @ID_AA_Carmack F8 🖤 irony
@v_g_fischer @Tesla There will be many opportunities for both new &amp; experienced people!
@atlasobscura fomo 4 yolo
@brandonbernicky Yeah, makes sense
Congrats to Tesla team on Model 3 winning best midsize car in Germany! 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪 https://t.co/4CDTf4c3eC
Will build batteries, powertrains &amp; vehicles, starting with Model Y
🖤♥️💛 GIGA BERLIN 💛♥️🖤
@KenHowery Congratulations!
Starlink vertical on the pad https://t.co/WuiB1piKcK
@xtrmmax @getjeda @Tesla Yes
@getjeda @Tesla Haha
@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace @yokem55 @waynehale Exactly
@SciGuySpace @yokem55 @waynehale Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species
@lexfridman Bad logic is always ugly
@RobGMacfarlane @nybooks @emilyraboteau Same goes for digital super intelligence denial
@zerohedge 😘 https://t.co/w0BkNGbvQ1
141 MPGe!
@stephenjudkins @flcnhvy Yes
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
@cleantechnica Gas/diesel cars too
@cleantechnica True
"Extremism is so fun! (@waitbutwhy)
https://t.co/ECACsaqAXR"
@BenSullins Yes
"The date is strangely familiar …
https://t.co/YZl5R1POJL"
Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
@uhaveanygrapes @Teslarati Looking into it
@Ryanth3nerd @Teslarati Yes
@FredericLambert @Teslarati The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF
@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Naturally
@Teslarati This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
@Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
@cleantechnica More to come
@bob_burrough Yes
@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
@flcnhvy Great poem
Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row.
@Teslarati Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!
"Tesla Solarglass vs 🎃
Happy Halloween!! https://t.co/p5tXeJYqne"
@stephenpallotta @Teslarati Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong
@Teslarati Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races.
@TeslaNY Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar!
@tobi @chris__lu @MarkRober @MrBeastYT Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
@flcnhvy The fires are all too real
@NutaIie Haha true
@TeslaStars @Tesla …
@johnkrausphotos @NASA @Space_Station Hard to say with high accuracy, but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess
Soon, SpaceX will launch @NASA astronauts to @Space_Station!
@themuskbros @teslaownersSV That’s significantly improved in current production
@RenataKonkoly @MrBeastYT @MKBHD True, my name literally means tree
@teslaownersSV If you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if you’re home &amp; to home if at work. Not sure if that’s in wide release yet, but def in early access. It’s an awesome feature.
“I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill.”
For Treebeard
@MKBHD @MrBeastYT Ok, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees
@MrBeastYT Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
@Jason @kylegrantham Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
@Jon4Lakers @Tesla We’re changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc
@kylegrantham Very true. Glass doesn’t burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.
@realDiegoMonroy I hate advertising
Unfortunately, it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to https://t.co/UvQa8JOE7v to add solar to an existing roof &amp; https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE for a new roof with integrated solar.
We don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot
If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today
Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires
@jasondunn So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
"Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important.
https://t.co/3y4M5L50qF"
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
@starshipsara Extremely high
@teslaownersSV Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters
US clean energy incentive drops by 4% on Jan 1, so orders must be received by roughly Nov 15 to be installed in time

@Cardoso @Erdayastronaut Transparent aluminum is a real thing! https://t.co/hX4XLih1Hk
@HarryStoltz1 That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!
Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!
@TeslaNY @SpaceX Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly.
🔥
@longnow @Liv_Boeree Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth.
To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9
@flcnhvy This product may appear simple, but actually *very* difficult to get right
Will do an open call Q&amp;A
@GerberKawasaki @Tesla Major FUD incoming for sure … haha

Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow https://t.co/EtqGAxDlAF
More carrot, less stick
Very likely that a home with clean power that’s lower cost than utility, plus blackout protection via Powerwall, will have a positive effect on value

@TesLatino @Erdayastronaut @NotEricRalph @MartianDays @torybruno @AerojetRdyne @elon Both at the same time!
@John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut @NotEricRalph @MartianDays @torybruno @AerojetRdyne More about dealing with failure modes &amp; roll control
@Erdayastronaut @NotEricRalph @MartianDays @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well.
@WorldAndScience Common myth, but incorrect
@slashdot And so begins the robocalypse …
Tesla wins best headlights award 🥇 https://t.co/8yfeJiXd0N
@Teslarati The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track
Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
@Erdayastronaut Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …
@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.
@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard
And the lead character is also named Woody https://t.co/ZxK84rB020
@NotEricRalph @MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines
@TTownJoe @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Conservation of energy tells you the answer
@Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq
@torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU
@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
@teslaownersSV @Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces.
@Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted Yeah, great team!
@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq
@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
@neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
@NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …
@annerajb @tesla_addicted Software

@aquastorm Yes, we will
@annerajb @YogiSC1127 @Tesla It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers.
@YogiSC1127 @Tesla Deep Rain™️ neural net coming soon. We’re not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep.
@teslaownersSV @28delayslater @Charalanahzard ♥️ hot pot

@Erdayastronaut Solar
@Erdayastronaut Depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess
@bonnienorman Whoa, that does look good!
@Macwars Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.

@tesla_truth @BarkMSmeagol @vincent13031925 @jchybow @JohnnaCrider1 @28delayslater @flcnhvy @AfMusk Super messed up situation!
@cleantechnica Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
@wk057 @Tesla Should be much better at this point
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
@brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …
@bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
@cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
@tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
@wilsonlam 😉
@annerajb @Thebault_Arthur Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.
@Thebault_Arthur Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive.
Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1

@SpacePadreIsle @SpaceX Wow, it’s been 5 years since we started at Boca!
@BrendanCogbill7 About a week. Will include slight improvements, based on initial user feedback.
@justpaulinelol We look for rare corner case issues with a limited release US build, then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities. So, soon, but hard to say exactly.
@GaryTheBot_ Gary, you rock!

@Wally_Wests Exactly
@Kristennetten @annerajb @Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut That would be a nice touch
@flcnhvy @28delayslater @DJSnM This is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so
@28delayslater @DJSnM Haha awesome
@MarkChica @Kristennetten @TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla We could probably do that
@Erdayastronaut 50m
@TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla Not sure we could go quite that tight, but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at user’s discretion
@annerajb @Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They don’t stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great.
@Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut Mk1 ship is around 200 tons dry &amp; 1400 tons wet, but aiming for 120 by Mk4 or Mk5. Total stack mass with max payload is 5000 tons.
@teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla Absolutely
@Teslatunity @Tesla You’re welcome! Feature requests always appreciated.

@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Mostly C/C++, Python &amp; SQL
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Tesla It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
@Teslarati This includes original engineering of new factory processes &amp; cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization.
@Teslarati Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car
@The_ShadowZone @DJSnM For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
@Erdayastronaut Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
@DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
@Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th.
@Erdayastronaut That’s correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver.
@bopinion Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what it’s worth, he has my support.

@Erdayastronaut @CptnCrutch5373 @Kalzsom Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver.
@happych19952208 😉
@CptnCrutch5373 @Erdayastronaut @Kalzsom Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
@Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg.
@Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3
@SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.
@SpaceXFan97 Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out.

@DMC_Ryan @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Exactly
@ElonAccessories @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati No, but very close
@DanielCardena @Teslarati Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys &amp; Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago.
@flcnhvy @Teslarati Absolutely
@justpaulinelol @Teslarati New Roadster and X will come later
@ZainRaz4 @Teslarati No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.
@Teslarati It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.
@BocachicaMaria1 Thanks, I will stop by on the 20th!

Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! ♥️♥️
@GaryTheBot_ Wise words from Gary the Bot
However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at https://t.co/sCkn87vMa9.
@TeslaForLife @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
@flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed
@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
@Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.

@MemesOfMars @Teslarati The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.
@nate_mccomb @Teslarati 48 61 20 68 61
@Teslarati The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
@Erdayastronaut @JHC2718 @MagnussonMani @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
@Erdayastronaut @IvanEscobosa @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Precisely
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok.
@Erdayastronaut @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric 🤣🤣
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there’s no weather in space
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability.
@Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult
@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Most likely

Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes
@justpaulinelol Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun).
@wingod @DJSnM @ThePhoenixFlare True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
@JaneidyEve Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
@HarryStoltz1 @ThePhoenixFlare Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
@ThePhoenixFlare Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming
@eatinggaming94 @4thFromOurStar 🤣🤣
Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
@SciGuySpace @hover389 AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based.

Great name! Wouldn’t worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit Earth eventually &amp; we currently have no defense.
@justpaulinelol Don’t know yet, but it’s important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so we’ll make costs as low as possible

With the new lower Tesla pricing, it’s like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious.
Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think … https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9

@bluemoondance74 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real.
@ajtourville @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B
@Tesla Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels
@TTVBaconz @Tesla Yes
@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Between $100B and $10T
@Erdayastronaut Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
@Erdayastronaut For sure
@Erdayastronaut Yup
@justpaulinelol Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.

@JaneidyEve @Teslarati No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
@Teslarati Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights.
Thanks George!
@brunosilva @vincent13031925 @ResidentSponge @Teslarati @Tesla We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world.
@cleantechnica But actual road data is what matters most https://t.co/q44lsjJZZa
@HarryStoltz1 @Sofiaan @IIHS_autosafety @atj721 Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
@HarryStoltz1 @Sofiaan @IIHS_autosafety @atj721 Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …

@TeslaClubIN @Yashwanthnadal For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.
@hi__hassan Not sure. Will check with my team.
@Yashwanthnadal I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
@SciGuySpace Orbital refilling is vital to humanity’s future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.

@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Wearing black not recommended https://t.co/lqoBFTeMX2
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.

“If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.” — Gen Shinseki
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
@JeanLikeDenim Probably
@ropiko Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them &amp; we won’t be able to.
@flcnhvy @SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week

@RenataKonkoly @28delayslater @CarolineGee8 @NathanBomey @USATODAY @Tesla @mayemusk That was a real sign
@AutonomousHoag @AutonobahnAI @AlexRoy144 @Tweetermeyer @valleyhack I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably, some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for years.

@C3LT_Games The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites. More on this later.
@ElonsWorld May the light of consciousness shine bright
@bluemoondance74 @Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @mayemusk @SpaceX Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising.
@DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Exactly
@EVAutonomy @DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
@DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car
@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @mayemusk @SpaceX Between first development engine &amp; first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware &amp; software. Over time, thousands.
@ElonsBrain @Tesla Upgrading to 250kW soon
@kulpability @lexfridman @Tesla Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety.
@austinbarnard45 @tossha_spb @atlasobscura Local supporters will be invited!
@DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Yes
@Kristennetten @lexfridman @Tesla ~Q4 2016
@dodiewill2 @lexfridman @Tesla End of Q4, most likely
@flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.
@lexfridman @Tesla This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars
@lexfridman @Tesla All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer

@NebraskaJR @Ninja FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.
@NebraskaJR @Ninja Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines
@Ninja Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.

@cleantechnica 2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
@bitbased @Antsmash @joseph_preece @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates That’s actually kinda true
@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent.
@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
@SciGuySpace Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
@Cocalarix @romaarra Probably sooner
@romaarra Ok
@TherrinKSCVC @SteelSully @annerajb @kickber @ExploreSpaceKSC Sure, that would be an honor
@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @MattLBates Most likely. It is programmed to do so.

@SptlightVids @SpaceX Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well.
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
@SpaceXUpdates @Erdayastronaut High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.

Falcon Heavy on LC-39A https://t.co/FsfFa7bRRK
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

@joe_mckirdy @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Depends on destination
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
@DatKlow Chomsky sucks
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
@Erdayastronaut @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

@13ericralph31 @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result.

@cleantechnica Yup
@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Would love to do exactly that
@Cosmic_Penguin Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.
@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.
@John_Gardi @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
@GoForStaging @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.
@1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers
@13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map. https://t.co/83MwIZAEP6 https://t.co/NllMXregRg
@varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. https://t.co/OuWYfNmw0D
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
@meme0boi Fair
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
@DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
@SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.
@teslaownersSV @Tesla Whoa cool 😀
@John_Gardi @Marco_Langbroek @SpaceX Yes
Beautiful solar sail
@mcjamez @_jameshatfield_ @danielcincu @Alex_Parker ISS is extremely gigantic &amp; has lights

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is complete nonsense
@TechVelocirap @M_xalher @Tesla @ValueAnalyst1 Exactly. A car being electric &amp; upgradable to full self-driving maximizes future resale value.
@marialauraadr It’s not my finest work 🤣
@M_xalher @Tesla @ValueAnalyst1 Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. Consumers are starting to realize this.

@MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX 👍
@SpaceX Krypton thrusters operative, satellites initiating orbit raise every 90 mins
@steveieb21 No
@Mike_Calhoun @PhenomenalPoto 🤣🤣 Absolutely
@TeslaTn Yes, 3 to 6 months
@alharding @ex_Tesla @El_Timbo @heikki_anttila Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
@quayran Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below
@flcnhvy @DMC_Ryan Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn’t matter
@DMC_Ryan Paperwork &amp; hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
@keyeslol @wofford_cameron @bourbonisgood2 LA has a subway, but most people don’t know about it
@DMC_Ryan That would great!
@justpaulinelol Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It’s optional!
Boring Company guide to why tunnels are awesome &amp; safest place to be in an earthquake https://t.co/ZZIPQlscw1
@SpaceXFan97 @kateconger So far, so good
@tesla_truth Ironically, same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value and imply Tesla is worthless. They can’t *both* be true!
@kateconger Gary the 🐌 still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
@EddiOS42 @Nepomucene @boringcompany This is simple and just works

@nichegamer @flcnhvy @Erik2be @Teslarati Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX, looking at rocket
@flcnhvy @Erik2be @Teslarati Part of the factory is being upgraded, but tours will continue around the parts that aren’t
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full.
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX ~2.8m
@alijamalashraf @Erdayastronaut @MichaelGalanin @SpaceX Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber.
@Erdayastronaut @Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy @marstronauts @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Horizontally
@flcnhvy @Malcolmmarsman @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20.
@InsideEVs So it goes
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX 3 months
@flcnhvy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Hopefully, 4 months
@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees
@tommleach @trigomemetry https://t.co/ViY0WgtfOZ
@trigomemetry Sure
@DirkSmit76 Two tunnels about a mile long each
@Debapratim15 @curiousmind44 @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @JeffBezos Yes
@curiousmind44 @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @JeffBezos Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!
@_ishanspatil @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth
@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version.
@13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Aspirationally
@JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX 3 sea level optimized Raptors, 3 vacuum optimized Raptors (big nozzle)
@13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX After the GoT finale, we dropped it to 6
@SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Mk1 &amp; Mk2 ships at Boca &amp; Cape will fly with at least 3 engines, maybe all 6
@bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer
Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in 2 months. Aiming to finish by end of year.
@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer &amp; impellers.
@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX But, essentially, the spinning things
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower.

@flcnhvy Top Secret https://t.co/Gi2wN2HVyO
@MillShive @ChrisG_NSF @jdeshetler It technically could, but wouldn’t have enough mass margin for a heat shield, landing propellant or legs, so not reusable
@MyCatNameIsShad No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives &amp; forks are made of.
https://t.co/48s5D3IfWs
Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels
@maggiejuang1 Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways. https://t.co/XeBB5iP7mo

@Torgo82 @FredericLambert Absolutely
@billseymour Seriously
@FredericLambert Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez …
@FredericLambert Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV’s have high fire risk when opposite is true.
@teslaownersSV @jeffleach Thanks, support super appreciated
@jeffleach Sad if true 😔
When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious.
Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never …
@martinengwicht @msitver @FrankLuntz Anti-matter def wins on energy density 🤣🤣

@scottwww @ValueAnalyst1 @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds.

@sjensenknight It’s not a big deal. Charge to 90% to 95% &amp; you’ll be fine. At 100% state of charge, regen braking doesn’t work, because the battery is full, so car is less energy efficient.

Thinking about adding giant stainless steel dragon wings to Starship
@EforElectric @WSJ That tweet did take immense effort 🤣🤣 Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps.

@johnrobb Exactly
@Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement How embarrassing. Will change.
@Chapter11Cases We will. You read it right.
@arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Haha true
@martinengwicht @KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb @Tesla @ElonMuskScience I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
@cSharp3x7 @Savis1949 @WSJ Good point, small oil is a problem too
@FredericLambert @GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels …
@GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.
@GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ True, Bloomberg is almost as bad
@Savis1949 @WSJ Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock 🧦 puppets of big oil
@grzf_ Starship is kinda Gundam
@KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.
@Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.

@CBSNews Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop.
@tsrandall Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.
@tsrandall There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints.
@CalinRoman3 @GregMatson Yes
@GregMatson Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date
@Erdayastronaut @kneibert Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
@FredericLambert Yes
@yaypie There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase
@Rebel44CZ Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
@brandonbernicky @tsrandall Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
@tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
@kneibert Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
@frozencanuck Something like that

@annerajb @TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Any user input counts
@TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change.

@bluemoondance74 @solussd @Tesla I’m told it’s looking positive &amp; we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
@solussd @Tesla Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
@slye @LivingTesla @Tesla Impressive analysis
@LivingTesla @Tesla Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera.
@LivingTesla @Tesla Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows &amp; rear window.
@LivingTesla @Tesla It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video.
@LeoDotWalsh0x05 Will take care of it
@dave_chung @Tesla Ok

@jake_cooley @SnazzyQ Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input.
@EV_Stevee @Tesla Great name 👍
@SnazzyQ Neural net is upgraded too in this release. It’s not just a settings change.
@SherylCrow @Tesla Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup.

@SherylCrow @Tesla Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!

@EVLatino @SherylCrow @Tesla Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower &amp; allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
@GaragedoorsGman @SherylCrow @Tesla Agreed
@SherylCrow @Tesla Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.

@TesLatino @mcjamez @TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Tesla Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest
@TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey.
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare.
@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible.
@emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.
@MacBenTosh Anyone who bought FSD will get it
Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.
@DiscoverMag We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there …
@erinwinick @techreview Super cool!

"@SkiddlyBinx Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.

Yes, but we’re going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads."

@Mathias_Wehler @Sloppy93 @Erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots
@Sloppy93 @Erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Only some of the hottest sections
@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Full size
@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
@THE_REAL_KEAGAN @Tesla @LikeTeslaKim @BenSullins @teslainventory Agreed
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
@omarqazi @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …
@flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.
@austinbarnard45 First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.

@AskDrStupid @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Yes!
@lexiheft @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades aren’t so crazy
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production
@dave_ross @Tesla Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer
@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity.
@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions.
@Tesla @PopMech Still get this question a lot, even though Norway 🇳🇴 has highest Tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

@brandynspears 6
@FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla In retrospect, lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
@johnny0129 However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
@johnny0129 We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
@jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
@soundanswer @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Yes
@marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too

@Drew78823936 @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although they’re critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term.
@DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesn’t have same safety criticality as crew.
@dmk184 @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface

@raulv48 @bryanMackSC @Tesla We’re trying to make EVs &amp; autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company.
@Sofiaan @royalflushGK Will take a few days for system update
@TonyCrisostomo @tesla_truth @royalflushGK Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back.
@abhaygupta @royalflushGK It’s not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term
@royalflushGK If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k

@katlinegrey @lrocket @Alexis_wwww Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder.
@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel.
@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Yes, exciting potential
@flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly
@annerajb @lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet.
@DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
@lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect &amp; appreciation!

@rogiermaas @SpaceX Deorbits &amp; burns up over the Pacific
@Erdayastronaut @CanzyD Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; Dragon abort thrusters.
@SpaceXUpdates @CanzyD Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so
@nextspaceflight Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big.
@CanzyD High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.

@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
@benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
@RichPitre_CO @katlinegrey We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done
@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.
@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don’t know
@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd
@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close
@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX About 11 secs
@alexmd2 @SpaceX Definitely! It’s amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by @SpaceX engine/test team! https://t.co/yPrvO0JhyY

@Erdayastronaut @LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.
@Malcolmmarsman @Erdayastronaut Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
@Erdayastronaut Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles.
@Erdayastronaut The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy

@nickynaptime Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesn’t even need paint!
@SpaceXFan97 @wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
@wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Mostly true
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.
@TriTexan @SpaceX Yes
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas https://t.co/8JCOi1BG6z
@Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

@Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine
@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.
@Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp
@CabsandSurfaces Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
@teslamodel3fan @Tesla Since it’s part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it
Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
@DevClub_Space @RationalEtienne @PopMech Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels.
@thecla6771 Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
@PopMech When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water

@cleantechnica How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
@musicnick1985 @Teslarati Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX
@nextspaceflight @Teslarati The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication
@Teslarati The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

@magoo5042 @Tesla Ok
@JP_Cautillo Wow!
@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:
https://t.co/FZVNlGWYgA"
And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.
There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M

@_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word “star” or “link” 😀
@ludan27 @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars.
@John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Coldformed at cryo
@Malcolmmarsman @TheMuddySchmuck @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
@thescalex @Jonas123denmark @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Exactly
@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry.
@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
@wangmeister If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference
@wangmeister It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end
@MikeKasprzik @Tesla Try connecting to WiFi
"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.

Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr or visit stores."

@JohnKasich Thanks, will consider next year
@nichegamer @boringcompany So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this won’t matter for the first few layers

@c7five @Jaku 👍
Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference: https://t.co/LS4EhN57Mw
Join our underground movement!
@DeadstockNYC Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out
@vicentes @Attack @Tesla Ok 😀💨
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? https://t.co/vxcZ2Hi2qx
@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly
@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.
@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.
@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.
@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.
@FredericLambert @boringcompany You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear.
@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!
@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy
A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety.
Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
@joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely
Presentation starting at 8:15
@CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go
The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start
@flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better.
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.
@alanrrios @boringcompany Yes
This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla

@businessinsider This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound. https://t.co/VxO9rR1uAf
@John_Papa @Tesla You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
@Malcolmmarsman Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
@business Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”.
@annerajb About 10 to 14 days
Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)
"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.

To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at https://t.co/46TXqRJ3C1 or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
@erikstorli No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
@lgebman I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change.

Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
@vincent13031925 @teslectrics @60Minutes @MKBHD Probably next month
@teslectrics @60Minutes You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
@javagiri @Tesla We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week.
@fluffypony @Tesla Probably end of next year
@DOfaquarius @ElonsBrain @LiveBit_io @60Minutes So true 🦙💩✨😴
@60Minutes This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
@MesQueUnBanjo We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
@ghhaugen Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability.
Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.
If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.
@RenataKonkoly @SpaceX Machete!!
@danwat1234 It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.
Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later. https://t.co/NxCgYO9JXx
@nichegamer Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China.
@brandonorselli Buying https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like https://t.co/BsRfMrY9Gm even when we were only making 🚘.
Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.
@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati Yes
@cleantechnica Interesting
@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong
@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati The new design is metal
@Erdayastronaut @w00ki33 @Teslarati As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing https://t.co/6Hv2aZhLjM
Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon. https://t.co/O3h8eCgGJ7
@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.
@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
@markkrieger Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.
Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.
Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes
@mattbeckman Us too sigh
Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim.
64 satellites 🛰 on this flight!
@Jennerator211 @PPathole @JohnnaCrider1 We’re adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months
@JohnnaCrider1 Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here.
@LittleMissFlint It is so hard to move in armor!
@boringcompany You’re all hired!
@LittleMissFlint Yes … no … maybe …
None shall pass!
@bonnienorman @tomb2192 @carpenter_maas Ok
@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice
@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you’re ok
@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth.
@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.
@johnkrausphotos Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon

@pfierens @LikeTeslaKim Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience.

@poeticZay Yes
@NBCNews This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.
You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent.
Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive.

@Model3Owners Should be next week
@annerajb No, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9
@mwolman98 Later versions will
Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)
Renaming BFR to Starship
@universal_sci No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR
@YoBigBrotha Yes
Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.
@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast
@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.
@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Ok
@ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
@WillFealey Investigating
@vincent13031925 @jsteinerman Probably mid 2019
@LION_LIFER Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
@WillFealey Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not.
@acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @Tesla Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
@ajaotj36 No, but perhaps in a few years
@stars4a_amy Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app.
@jsteinerman Haha, just like Super Troopers
@WillFealey Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
@FrameshiftShark Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive.
@FrameshiftShark Radical change
Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.
@annerajb It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times.

@vincent13031925 Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain
@madera_raul Yes
Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently.
@FredericLambert We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
@victorpoughon Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location.

@_sheateher @MalibuWine Is he ok?
It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.
@karaswisher Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
@kenlacovara Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)
Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?
@SeanGVarney That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …
@zandywithaz Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
@JackCydia Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3.
If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.
@tizmagik @TeslaSupport Fair point, will reenable
@mihk101 Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety.
Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
@exzacklyright @MKBHD @austinnotduncan @Tesla Cool

@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Yes
@Tesla Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
@Erdayastronaut @annerajb No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas
@Erdayastronaut @annerajb Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
@annerajb Aiming for orbital flight by June

@DatHandsomeJerk @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation
@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020
@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.
@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.
@Teslarati Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!

Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past 2 years (Autopilot hardware V2+).
Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
@rarelyserious @Tesla For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid &amp; park.
@rarelyserious @Tesla Cool haha

@SnazzyQ @FredericLambert Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
@SnazzyQ @FredericLambert Don’t worry, we’ll make it right
@CGasparino @Tesla The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
@Model3Owners Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
@Lindowitz @FredericLambert It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …
@CGasparino @Tesla Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?
@sk2sno @rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla We will enable track mode for all performance cars
@rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund
@ctgm @FredericLambert Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer
@FredericLambert Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
@annerajb @FredericLambert @pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey Exactly. That’s Monday.
@officialjaden Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm.
@pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey No, but I will
@mangeHDbackup Isn’t it obvious?
@yames51 @DigitalDunzey Worth it
@vincent13031925 @cleantechnica @CNBC @businessinsider @business @WSJ @Teslarati @InsideEVs True
Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
@sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal.
@fb1975 @DigitalDunzey Haha
@DigitalDunzey On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%.
@nichegamer @raissabontempo @SomeGrayAreas @reddit @Twitter Reddit is massive, but def has gems
@SomeGrayAreas @reddit @Twitter Reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real Reddit
@Mcgillligan Exactly
@FactsDataTruth @Tesla You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great.

@houmanhemmati @FredericLambert There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past.
@FredericLambert Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week.
To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want.
@cleantechnica Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars

Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so
@dennishegstad It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see.
Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires.
@DannyMekic It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February

@smeranda Yes, aiming for next few months
@ajmarquez True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.

@JacksMacintosh @SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert I believe it’s $5k
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Still a long way to go
Model 3 motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.

@martyeuler @MebFaber Fair point 😀
@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!
@MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide. https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR
@Model3Owners V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.

@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking.
@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder
@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.
@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators
@Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time
@FlintSchools @MuskFoundation You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.

@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.
@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.
@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL
@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.
@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
@LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side
@LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts
Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
@MartenBenjamin @NHTSAgov @Tesla Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much.

Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour.
Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy

@mliebow @Tesla Much appreciated! Great word-of-mouth is why Model 3 is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements.
@FredericLambert @pooktd The multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity
@pooktd Sorry, we’ve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint &amp; quality in general. If need be, we’re repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done.

@GrowthHackers This is why a small company with tight focus &amp; high energy can beat a big company without
@SeanHQuinn @yanquetino @Tesla This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
@yanquetino @Tesla Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs.
@j_brorsson @InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time …
@InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Maybe …
@AskDrStupid This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The extension cord was 1000 miles long, but still
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert What’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord
@Tesla In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public.

@momof3terrors Thanks, great feedback. Will be a fun  project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new &amp; delightful to see.
@FredericLambert @woodhaus2 Production design will be better, especially in details. We are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of Model 3 &amp; bringing Y to market

@lexiheft @FredericLambert @lexfridman Sorry, meant to say same timeframe as hardware
@komocode @FredericLambert @lexfridman Yes
@FredericLambert @lexfridman Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot.

@MindFieldMusic Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
@thatspacegeek Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)
@FredericLambert No change
Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares &amp; go private
@heydave7 Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
@EvotoRentals Yes
@FredericLambert I don’t have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.

@AndredAlmeida Yeah, Model 3 is designed to fit 6’4”  adults comfortably in both front &amp; rear seats at same time
We’re adding a “party &amp; camper mode” soon to S/3/X, so your car can maintain air flow, temp, selective lights, music &amp; power devices for 48 hours or more while parked. Big batteries rock …
Not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means there’s room for trunks in front &amp; back, plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car
@Tesla Hard drive industry is hardcore. They build &gt;100 million units per year with extreme precision &amp; brutal economics. Great background.
@DiscoverMag There’s a massive amount of CO2 on Mars adsorbed into soil that’d be released upon heating. With enough energy via artificial or natural (sun) fusion, you can terraform almost any large, rocky body.

@DMC_Ryan Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
@bevvscott @eehouls Exactly
@eehouls No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?
@HelloCullen Already have
@blake_kistler @BBCWorld Ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed.
@LanceUlanoff @BBCWorld Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time.
@Sarthk007 @BBCWorld Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point
@BBCWorld Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.
@BBCWorld The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: https://t.co/dmC9l3jiZR
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful. https://t.co/EHNh8ydaTT
@Noizey_Man @JaneidyEve That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
@EnochKo @Anna_online A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
@JaneidyEve Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
@Anna_online According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage.
Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage https://t.co/2z01Ut3vxJ
@2morrowknight Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.
@bweikle According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages
@binarybits @JaneidyEve Tube diameter is 31cm
@JaneidyEve Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool
@imscoops It is an honor to work with them
With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space
https://t.co/D1umiFDr1t
@IAmJohnMcMahon I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
@DocJohnG @PewellaClarke @dcliem It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
@KyleBrubaker Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.
@PPathole @JimmyVosika @dcliem Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.
@astrography__ @dcliem Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.
@dcliem  https://t.co/jL2sPT0NCp
@dcliem Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
@MontanaSeptic @dcliem Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand
@dcliem Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.
@vcastillo630 @adblanche I am an engineer
@annerajb @kulpability @sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Tight control code is always C
@annerajb @sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Python is done right. Great name story too.
@DocJohnG @dcliem If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one
@sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot 🖤🖤🖤 Python 🖤🖤🖤
@dcliem Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
@KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Turbo
@Grady_Booch @slashdot C
@ayshardzn Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.
@DowdEdward Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. https://t.co/t5XRo3gTxK
@slashdot Yes
@dirkbonhomme @JelteDesign @maysacha Yes
@JelteDesign @maysacha Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
@abroadwithalec @maysacha Yes
@maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.
@thanr @ablack82 I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
@aiyanaskye Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand
Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.
Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.
@VoltzCoreAudio Ground winds would
@VoltzCoreAudio Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
@jevjack1 Can’t be too buoyant
Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.
@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea
@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.
@LittleMissFlint You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.
@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
@jeremysliew It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.
@erikveen I would def recommend this
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks
@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.
@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.
@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.
@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
@MelissaLeeCNBC @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said
@jowens510 @lopezlinette I didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. They just don’t like hypocrites.
@lopezlinette They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true? https://t.co/jy7sQkZ4R5
@S_Padival @lopezlinette Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective https://t.co/eaLVIgwm7k
@S_Padival @lopezlinette  https://t.co/ystkbF7p1W
@S_Padival @lopezlinette .@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective https://t.co/oy1Tz6Cg68
@Rayhawn @Tesla Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so.
@ajs @nichcarlson @businessinsider @lopezlinette Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
@tombrechet @vassilyk @FlatJannrickles @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette @Tesla Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
@vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism.
@scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?
@TeslaBull What a coincidence …
@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
@stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?
@benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer.
@ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion.
Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. https://t.co/xSG2Mmy756
@S_Padival @lopezlinette Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?
@gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters.
@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?
@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target.
@LittleMissFlint Happy to support
@MabzMagz Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. Don’t know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps.

@PPathole @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.

@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate
@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “… of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”
@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”

@GetMyGist As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all.
@xkcdComic This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.
@lazarusrang Humanity is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got
@xkcdComic Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn’t have happened at all.

Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what “money” is.
@xJawz @joerogan Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

@AntVenom @cfarivar @amendlocke You’re probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down.
@cfarivar @PPathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @JayPrisefighter @EBRPD I’m at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. It’s big.
@cfarivar @PPathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @JayPrisefighter They look beautiful
@cfarivar @loosecoosebbq @akrdu2 @Tesla @Fremont_CA Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
@PPathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar It’s actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
@maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
@JayPrisefighter @cfarivar They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
@joshsteimle @monongahelaEX @AntVenom No
@cfarivar Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much ♥️🚘💫
@scottlynch78 @jenphalian You’re welcome, bad fiction writer 78 https://t.co/ypglGbdEse
@cfarivar @amendlocke Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can’t even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer.
@amendlocke Your union brothers https://t.co/DsGvlscvc6
@amendlocke You won’t find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
@Keith_Wasserman @Jason @Beyonce @warriors Thanks, good advice
@FredericLambert @SwiftOnSecurity They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
@c7five Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I’m driving.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin @RickandMorty Can’t wait for the new @RickandMorty season to start!
@goombar3 We’ve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.
@taimurstriker Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.
@mk_rodgers They started it &amp; attacked me personally
Search UAW and “corruption”. Very long reading list. Great organization. https://t.co/9RVR31vzbc
@SwiftOnSecurity They don’t seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
@haymarketbooks Engels wrote 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes based on Marx’s “notes”. Less reliable.
@SwiftOnSecurity Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware.
@doctorow @sahazel Wow, you know nothing &amp; are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldn’t care less.
@JohnnaSabri @slack2thefuture @doctorow Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?
@JohnnaSabri @slack2thefuture @doctorow Iron pyrite
@JimPuzzanghera Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!
@spookyozzy @slack2thefuture @doctorow You’re just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I’d fail &amp; be back in 3 months.
@TeslaCharts I don’t want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.
@slack2thefuture @doctorow You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position.
Well said https://t.co/lDPaIPLLzO
@TeslaCharts Then you’ll be fine
@JohnnaSabri @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate.
@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.
@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.
@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.
@TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too.
@Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
@AntVenom @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.
@doctorow Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case.

@NelStamp @RRescenko If I’m not a communist, why do I make red cars 🚘 🤔
@kikkerin @soniasimone Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness.
@Gubisoul @monongahelaEX @AntVenom That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
@soniasimone lol
@monongahelaEX @AntVenom Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good.

By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all.
"“No sense of humor” is certainly proving itself true. Good grief!

@R850Mango @tinytacotown Boys High is a government school for anyone local, which we were

@elmaddogg @tinytacotown No
@tinytacotown My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
@CarltonTSC There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation.
Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom.
@Jack_Frodo Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
@AntVenom Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.
@AntVenom A socialist

@garyflickinger @OchamsRazr @VR0NLINE Of course, but it’s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we’re never going to make them again.
@Erdayastronaut @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons
@Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof.
@Caio_1999_ @LanceUlanoff Not recommended for urban environments
@ThatGuyKnapp @LanceUlanoff Yes
@poriya_ravi @WorldAndScience The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.
@oheather1337 @WorldAndScience It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
@WorldAndScience Love this design. Simpler the better.
@DeeLex_MCEM @VHollywood21 Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀
@raptorweb Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.
@Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
@VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.
@MKBHD Will do
@bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.
@MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another.
@LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.
@LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.
@anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔
Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.
@trace_remick @FredericLambert 20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
@FredericLambert In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
@FredericLambert That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents https://t.co/HPK5R5UMS6
At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps.
More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)
@FrankIppolito @boringcompany We don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
@djenkins6 Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…
SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …

@pmnordkvist Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
@Nate_072 @SpaceX Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter

@Model3Owners Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s.

@KumJm @STcom Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability.
@STcom But don’t worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything’s just fine https://t.co/cg4ooQSrX3
@STcom Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production.

@kevinmgill You’re saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a “good person”?
@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite! https://t.co/aXPsmLnh48
@HahTse @neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried “Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman.
@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.
@neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up.
@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too
@amasad @its_a_massacre @fung9815 @israrayyaz @Sra_Mister @waitbutwhy Great book. Read it when it came out.
@amasad @its_a_massacre @fung9815 @israrayyaz @Sra_Mister @waitbutwhy Exactly
@rhinopIasty SpaceX has Area 58 at Cape Canaveral. That’s 7 better than 51.
@amasad @Sra_Mister Yeah
@amasad @Sra_Mister Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
@JohnnaSabri @Sra_Mister Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
@PPathole @Sra_Mister Yes
@WorldAndScience You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
@G_Whitehead5 @DMC_Ryan @Model3Owners @Tesla Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money.
@davidtayar5 @annerajb @LikeTeslaKim I really want to make this cupholder
@LikeTeslaKim I’ve literally had dreams about cup holder designs
@LikeTeslaKim Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!

@joshuatopolsky @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media. https://t.co/c01JolZENY

@oneunderscore__ @joshuatopolsky @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same.

@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media.
@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
@ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @oneunderscore__ @ashleyfeinberg Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media
@RBryant2012 Yup, deleted

@TKhopshanosov @SaxMike71 @ebol94 @teslainventory @Tesla A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.

@chick_in_kiev @evepeyser @broderick Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out.
@nilgirian Worth a shot
@evepeyser @broderick Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …

@DavisTravis9830 @amywestervelt @Billsocalif @RMac18 @weinbergersa Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. ♥️ Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs.
@amywestervelt @Billsocalif @RMac18 @weinbergersa I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
@spacecom @amywestervelt @weinbergersa The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
@ObviousParadox @medickinson @thephysicsgirl No
@medickinson @thephysicsgirl Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry. https://t.co/WQp8j9YkeJ
@amywestervelt @weinbergersa Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches.
@weinbergersa Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please.

@PassionPlanet1 @supernovaslight @lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
@lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.
@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman I did to any who asked
@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it.
@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco @Tesla Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved

If you’re in media &amp; don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …
@meharris 🤗
@ParkerMolloy I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.
@meharris Of course
@scottwww @JessicaHuseman It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company.
@JessicaHuseman @reveal No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously
@iShashankBhatia Will do
Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
@scotch_io That’s why editors are included too
@SophieWarnes We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.
@DetroitVictoria Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
@AntVenom Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
@Virtualanom Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army
@sakiwebo Exactly
Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …
@dancow @WSJ An exception that proves the rule
@CodyBrown Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?
Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers.
@teddymonacelli The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
@jaspar Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
@andyjayhawk Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.
The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them https://t.co/Ay2DwCOMkr

@DeusEx Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
@matthunter Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote &amp; find out.
@speea @AlterViggo @juliacarriew In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.
We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?
@OldManLink Good point
@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class “lords &amp; commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.
@mikeyfranklin @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …
@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 No problem
@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!
@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 I didn’t meet with him
@dinisguarda I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert @Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.
@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production.
@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.
@camgfrost @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little
@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
@teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.
@LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.
@reveal @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA @Al_Letson Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com.
@MrsYomaddy @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
@Dani21 @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA ♥️🦄
@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.
@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal.

@georgechang @Tesla For sure before snowfall this year
@clprenz @ivanovi_ivaylo Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
@ivanovi_ivaylo With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.
@willardslammo @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
@MacTechGenius @marshall5912 @buckycovington Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union.
@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.
@AKSINGH_S Yes
@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
@paulmacguyscott Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
@Josh_Soto They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.
@JimmyRussellExe It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell
@AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.
@zacharyj98 Good idea ...
@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks
Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
@plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing
@clemyeung Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
@Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight

@andrewbg Time will tell, but so far it appears so
@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.
What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU
@sokane1 @TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins Yes
@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.
@mayemusk Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.
@arstechnica Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising.

@Everman SpaceX will prob build 30 to 40 rocket cores for ~300 missions over 5 years. Then BFR takes over &amp; Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars &amp; eventually outer planets.
Good piece by Ars https://t.co/7C3X0TjUX9
@RitaJKing Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
@DylanNeumann2 @Everman Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines — quaint, but not something you’d actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general.
@Everman Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them.

@existentialcoms Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week https://t.co/zAZOohjb4E
@existentialcoms No use arguing with chimp. You’re blocked.
@existentialcoms That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass 🎩 …

@DMC_Ryan @AnthonyFultz AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, that’s when we *start* making them. Can’t instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so.
@existentialcoms Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …
@AnthonyFultz @DMC_Ryan I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp
@DMC_Ryan Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
@nextspaceflight A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all

@FredericLambert It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
@GlobalProTrader @wmiddelkoop True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.
Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter
The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors
@MarekCyzio Exactly
First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while https://t.co/srEp1tf6ZU

@Ataraxia_Invest @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
@ThePhoenixFlare @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.
@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification
@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.

@amir Can’t believe you’re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.
@vegamontesino @NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn’t matter.
@NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I’m sure there’s a really great answer …
@WSJ Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?
@OmarHoryy @TeslaMotorsClub Seriously! Obviously, I’m not going to do an April Fool’s joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh).
@TeslaMotorsClub Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.

@realDonaldTrump To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing.
@realDonaldTrump We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable.
@realDonaldTrump I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It’s like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.
@realDonaldTrump Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China, but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US
@realDonaldTrump For example, an American car going to China pays 25% import duty, but a  Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference
@realDonaldTrump Do you think the US &amp; China should have equal &amp; fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints &amp; other factors.

@SpaceX Very proud of the SpaceX team! Can’t believe it’s been fifty Falcon 9 launches already. Just ten years ago, we couldn’t even reach orbit with little Falcon 1.
Falcon 9 flight 50 launches tonight, carrying Hispasat for Spain. At 6 metric tons and almost the size of a city bus, it will be the largest geostationary satellite we’ve ever flown.
@keithbigelow Very sensible summary of supersonic flight. Obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag &amp; low boom amplitude at ground. If boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too.
@simonhackett @ToddBourne @Tesla Good points. Will add to feature list.
@simonhackett @ToddBourne @Tesla Yeah, that should improve soon. Software team has been buried in Model 3 bringup and tricky bug fixes, but that’s mostly done now.

Want to clarify that as individuals, the people responsible for the high costs &amp; long timelines are almost all well-meaning, but the system of incentives is messed up
Higher safety &amp; environmental requirements &amp; labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy &amp; a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost.

@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
@kerrbones @nextspaceflight Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
@octagrabber @nova_road @nextspaceflight No
@nova_road @nextspaceflight A Shortfall of Gravitas
@nextspaceflight A third is under construction
@DJSnM @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected.
@DavideDF_ @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.
@doug_ellison @DavideDF_ @dsfpspacefl1ght https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq
@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Of course :)
@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023
@dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.
@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.
@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

@Barnacules To be more inclusive, how about a "pick your tech level" setting. Could make the Tesla sound like horses (coconuts!), chariots, steam engines, gasoline cars, ...
@patriciapaje Aim for 10 kN of thrust on a 200 kg sled. a=F/m ... game over.

@FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Assume the worst. Now I need to get back to work...
@teslamodel3fan @FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Answers: Yes. No. Doesn't matter.
@FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is "What color?". Don't need a configurator for that.
@FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference.
@MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Dec will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now
@OutOnALumb @engadget Yeah
@nextspaceflight @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!
@annerajb Med medical equipment has priority
@MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Probably 6 to 8 weeks
@blundell_apps You'll know as soon as we do. We are deep in production hell 🔥

@Temeyers Semi specs are better than anything I've seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now.
Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks &amp; increase battery production for Puerto Rico &amp; other affected areas.
@MacTechGenius @Jon4Lakers @solarcity @Tesla Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action …
@ismailnathij @stapf @Tesla The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
@ismailnathij @stapf @Tesla Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums.
@ricardorossello Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today
@ricardorossello I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful.
@RickandMorty Hell yeah, with that crew, we will party like Escobar and Cobain wish they could've partied!!

@AndrewKemendo Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary.
@ItchGrid Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.
@SethicusGP NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately
@JakeBlueatSM May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory
China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo.

@RolfeWinkler @julieverhage Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here: 🔥💩

Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears

@SpaceX @INTELSAT Thanks @INTELSAT! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was 28,000 km, Falcon 9 achieved 43,000 km.
SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good. https://t.co/R3YrF6PEt4
@SpaceX We're going to spend the 4th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than 5th/6th. Only one chance to get it right …
Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec
Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500.
Model 3 passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
@cristian_miuta @TeslaMotors Norway is awesome
@30akshay Actually, China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things, that's where iPhones, many Android phones &amp; most laptops are made.

@nullpointr More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
@amirmasoudabdol Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours.
@BenjaminCoop3 Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
@mjmdavis Still humans
@TheCocoaNaut Significantly improves control force
Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight. https://t.co/6ZcSG29B74

@dnathe4th @DJSnM We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago
@CrappyUsername Not only that, it has all the wifis and 3G is coming soon
@EcoHeliGuy Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
@zerosixbravo @john_gilleran True, but that's a minor factor for rockets
@ClovenLife No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.
@DJSnM They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that.
@zerosixbravo Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups
Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding. https://t.co/SmyCCQRt2F
@sajo Sticking to 100
@Emerald0013 It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace
Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good
Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.

@FredericLambert @samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
@samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama … Prob worth doing?
@samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only 7% of parts ended up being common.

@BigDAK54 I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
@WaldekKubicki @shazm01 Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
@sethjacob14 Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot.
@shazm01 We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
@douglasprest Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety
@noradio @MCornell0 @marks22 Exactly
@tony_lo Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
@freerobby @jetkohli There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
@marks22 HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
@harropj Hopefully June for those too
@MacBenTosh S for sure. It is a bigger car.
@jetkohli I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3.
@TheAvinashSingh Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that.
@rrosenbl Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth.
@ethank Almost there, plus much improved web browser
@kedyson1 That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July

Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you, aliens! So obtuse! You have all this crazy tech, but can't speak English!?
Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
@BadAstronomer We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
@tesla_addict @TeslaMotors Working on it
@jasonlamb Looks like it could do 20% more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
@cheron A lot
@Cardoso Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of 1st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend &amp; Monty Python.
@redletterdave Good point, odds go from 0% to &gt;0% :)
Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot.
@oxfordteddy Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
@BadAstronomer @SpaceX Thanks Phil!
Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.
If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times
@drmanejwala @arctechinc On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance.
@danahull Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model 3.
@business Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
@nickg_uk @chouky02 No
@nickg_uk @chouky02 You won't care
@NakatomiTim What gave me away?
@nickg_uk No
Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ... https://t.co/mA8ZgutrbE
Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to.
@erikhaaland We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
@Isabelle_Kent Yes
@D1sneyNut Yes
@nickbaum I believe so
@nddugan Yup
@Mr_Ewe_Guy Oh so little faith
@kryniog The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
@ToddGerkens Yeah
@HolsMichael Start taking orders in April
@dr_angus Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery.
@akaWrecks @ckalapala Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles …
@CamKode The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
@BlueBowles If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week.
@juanmlemao No problem :)
@DJBurges Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can.
@faultywarrior @matt_trulli @FredericLambert @TimShelton @JimPengelly Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
@TimShelton @FredericLambert @JimPengelly First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months.
@meangene2030 Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 https://t.co/zcs6j1YRa4
@FredericLambert It still has one display
@VoltzCoreAudio Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
@arctechinc The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?
@asimo3089 How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
@trabru Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!
@oakhaller I think so
@FredericLambert @JimPengelly No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S.
@Trojan81 Tues/Wed
@jDaz Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
@timothymjr Tues/Wed next week
@Skate_a_book Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away.
@JimPengelly Yes, but not until next year
@AlSaibie Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
@theKen_Miller Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot
@Greg525 How about now?
@varunfatehpuria Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
@luciojr All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
@swindeez Definitely
Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)
@TimBeiko Yes
Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.
Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the "next version" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true.
@macwalterslives Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
@aaronpaul_8 I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful.
@nextspaceflight @inversedotcom Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
@lennart375 @inversedotcom The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
@phirate Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle.
@Nites I hope that didn't work
@Nites ~spawn npc.alien
Where are the #%*&gt; aliens? https://t.co/FDuJIdwgrN
@wouterhuijs Looks like Tues/Wed for 8.1 release
@x17online Except that isn't actually my house ...
@karaswisher Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it.
@karaswisher I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
@CapnJesus @Lurpatron @MKBHD @jakerawr 3 is a great car, but definitely Model S
@kyleugh Good point
@PriyancaFord I wish. It's so annoying.
Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ... https://t.co/kGpJHNgRJO
@AndreElijah Ok
@BizbuilderUSA @mcannonbrookes It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results
@Legit_bacon @mcannonbrookes Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ.
@5AllanLeVito @mcannonbrookes @VGroysman Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency.
.@mcannonbrookes Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches
Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes
@ah_pton16 I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
@JMMZHerrera Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda "digitizes" DC power
@williamwinters High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at https://t.co/FOjClHhYiL
Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC.
You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC. https://t.co/7uXoUQf29f
@mcannonbrookes Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution.
@shails Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control
@mcannonbrookes $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
@Zedd Will send you one
@SimonaKitzu Self-hatred

SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
@MacTechGenius of course
@DueDiamond maybe one of those too
Roller coasters are awesome
@johnpaulbrewer Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
@donbarbieri @GreenCarReports Good chance it will
@davidshepardson @BW @ATT @ToysRUs Exactly :)
@adrianvolts Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
Excellent Tesla Model X review https://t.co/wvog4Pbo1o
Just posted a video https://t.co/RCV7MVi8rs
https://t.co/6Ve3YJoStm
@mattnewby no
@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018.
@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question
If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.
Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast… https://t.co/upjTcmftte
spacex's photo https://t.co/ImEDAut3nI
Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in 2018 https://t.co/usUto6QSi7
Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow. https://t.co/bQf97lywn4
@emenietti @chafkin Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed
@sc00bs It's much easier to do the CGI that way

@PhoebeColeman I used that one :)
Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much.
@VRGTech @Floydilicious They are doing India proud
@osiris26 You may come to regret that request :)
@LittleDovah Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?
@Floydilicious Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!
Apparently, there is this thing called "Dad jokes" and I make them
@LudwigMorelos You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man...
In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited. https://t.co/D68HNJcCoQ
Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
@lollieshopMOM Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
@SEACityLight @Nas2four Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful

George Schultz and Jim Baker article in @WSJ regarding a carbon tax https://t.co/tf2Urgms85
@BatlaG yes
@goel_ishan Hoping for summer this year
@mdcdave yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars.
@jovanik21 @Veidit No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100.
@jovanik21 Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further
@Veidit No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above.
@jovanik21 Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.
@quick_pi yes

Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
@qriosity_ @MacTechGenius No rare earth metals in battery
@camdtor @trylks Almost ready
@MacTechGenius App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
@FredericLambert Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority
@clay_ellis I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
@christesla @FredericLambert Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
@trylks A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
@FredericLambert Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text
@CycleTrades @rtoro20 People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
@Wise1919 @FredericLambert Rolling out a new update today.
@recipher We should try our best
@iamDeveloper Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless.
@martinengwicht @FredericLambert I just had three coffees :)

@FredericLambert Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
@brendangage I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful.
@DaringKid True. Me being one of them :)
@marcelsalathe Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to "1st" place means it's essentially on par
@andresantoniop Fair point, sorry
Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?
@RealPhillipPoon Needs a major overhaul
@BenCam137 @FifthRocket Exactly
@AanstadGard Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
@BullFlags Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
@W4AS Good grief, I'm not "working" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction.
@BitterMercy @CallumK24 Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)
@EricHaegler @iLexomat Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
@vladsavov Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.
@FifthRocket Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
@paulvankeep Mostly anti-drug laws
@zgiarrizzo Exactly
@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.
@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
@CallumK24 Ok, but what's up the wigs?
@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
@Biesseman True!
Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.
@nintendomaniac @alext4627 I wish!
@OldManRiver1800 Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism.
@bonnienorman @advandermeer Wow, cool!

There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
Regarding the meeting at the White House: https://t.co/8b1XH4oW6h
@lotte__world yes
@SarahFKessler @qz Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.

@MichaelEMann No they don't
@Nivo0o0 Was wondering what those were

@Michael_McLean That may be a difficult award to decline
Tillerson also said that “the risk of climate change does exist” and he believed “action should be taken"
@TheEconomist ... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."
@TheEconomist Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: "I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ...
@redletterdave Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ...
@danahull I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
@danahull Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.
@TheEconomist This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.
@dean_arexding There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
@tsrandall 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely
@stephenstohn Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present
Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data.
@dnansink40 Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
@TheSammyyyD For now
@HendrikStruik The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted
@gdoehne @reddit Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
@dtweiseth If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically
@dtweiseth Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
@RitaChung16 Yes
@VinnyLingham Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.
Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China! https://t.co/54wXBKiKvp

Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
@UKPJD Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory
@TOCHOTE Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
@cameronrad Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot
@ModularLifeSys @NHTSAgov It might. Am not sure.
@gavinnwaters Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.

@MotorTrend Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
@gurnam @brianstucki @reddit It is
@JRMYGRNBRGR Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful.
@trevoclark Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1.
@robsmallshire @ClareMacraeUK It will
Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
@mjreddyMD If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week
@redletterdave The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
@mbhnyc It will in an upcoming release later this year
@TeslaMotors Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar &amp; sonar.
@matt_mantyla @TeslaMotors Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
@OlivierW4 Longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in.
If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000
New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 &amp; to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
@fatihorhan @SpaceX That was a great game

@FredericLambert A mere 350 kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?
@yamenalhaddad Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
@FredericLambert There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place.

@adrianvolts @TeslaMotors @TeslaMotorsClub @Teslarati Tesla software team is working seven days a week to complete testing and validation. Getting close.
@ChromeJS10 Should start changing soon
I am actually going to do this
@TeslaMotors We are going to modify this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are occupied. If the site is basically deserted, no problem to park.

@Contra_9077 sounds right
@ArminKeyani All P100D vehicles produced to date, as well as new. This is purely a software optimization.
Model X numbers should also improve by 0.1 sec on 0 to 60 and 1/4 mile
Looks like the Model S P100D Easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 sec and a 10.6 sec 1/4 mile via software update next month
@ID_AA_Carmack we could enable that, although the cameras use grey, grey, grey, red detection, so it would look a little greyish red :)

@balaji_kann Primarily aluminium with hot-stamped boron steel reinforcements. B pillar has a glass overlay.
@BitterMercy Excellent safety in rollover (5 star+). That was what took so long to develop.
In addition, we reinforced the surrounding body structure for improved safety (was already 5 star in all categories).

@notch also, the Tesla is poison free!
@Scott_Helme can't always detect babies and pets
Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments.

Support &amp; advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com.
Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
@waitbutwhy It's been a little crazy lately
@scrappydog yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine.

@c4757p @SwiftOnSecurity Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience.
@SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
@nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks. Point of calling it "beta" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect.
@_CraigR @FortuneMagazine exactly
@wfederman @stegen @FortuneMagazine that wasn't criticism, just clarification
@SwiftOnSecurity why?
@wfederman @stegen @FortuneMagazine thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.

As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation.
Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck https://t.co/Sa6uCkpknY
Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
@fucktyler Thanks Tyler
Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
@AstroOrionMK @BadAstronomer Quite rapid... Yes
RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.

@BenjaminRPhoto @StephenPace Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious.
Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used
NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter

@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.

F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.

Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it… https://t.co/DpXsRQWal9
@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
@mbhnyc steel collet
Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. https://t.co/w007TccANJ
@Uncle_Gus probably
However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.

11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!
Background on the launch https://t.co/1SkttU684X
Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the https://t.co/bDd3GxQXMC webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral

This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday.
Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence …
Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
About 2 mins from static fire
@elonmusk holding for issue resolution
Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
5 mins from static fire test
@lukealization yes, from 70F to 20 F
@craigcocca It worked in Texas
@PaigeANjax -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.

@TobiasVdb The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit.
It is, however, important to clear up the difference between "space" and "orbit", as described well by https://t.co/7PD42m37fZ

Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise, having 2D streets and 3D buildings means bad traffic forever.
Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast, but immune to weather, quiet and no risk cars fall on your head
Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater, noisy, grounded in bad weather
Contrary to press reports, I'm not against flying cars. Just said it was important to consider both pros and cons.

@ID_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon
The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger: https://t.co/gTaURQQeyx
@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.
Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for "x-wing" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.
Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel &amp; rocket flyback in future.

The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower &amp; weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

@arthurblake Tesla service can do coating or can be done by any auto glass coating company. My car is done on side &amp; rear
@arthurblake Turn off AC recirc, so that cool air flows out thru rear vents &amp; get IR coating on rear glass.
@justinchace will do

Tomorrow night: fastest gas pump in LA vs Tesla battery pack swap http://t.co/QgZzggjIkq
Partial recall of Model S http://t.co/uDZ1f3RnjV
Battery pack swap works with all Tesla Model S cars, past and present. It was always there.
@zatulsky Shai actually got the idea from a visit to Tesla. The idea is obvious (many things allow battery swap), but the technology is not.
Video of battery pack swap will be posted to the Tesla website around 9:30pm, so those attending will see this first.
Live pack swap demo on Thurs night at 8pm California time at our design studio in Hawthorne. Seeing is believing.

Easier said than done. There is a lot of pressure from investors. It is hard not to feel super bad if u don't make ur qtr.
Mars requires developing complex technology over a decade+, but market cares about next 3 months. Result would be conflicting priorities.
@SQMInc I don't have a publicist
Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
Vac thrust of 700 tons means avg of 14 tons/floor of structural steel for a 50 story building.
@williamricci6 50% higher. ~1.3 M lbs sea level and ~1.5 M lbs vacuum thrust. Will be 60% higher with some tweaks.
1st firing of Falcon 9-R advanced prototype rocket. Over 1M lbs thrust, enough to lift skyscraper http://t.co/AUCsWTw77E

You Can Fit A Lot Of Kindergartners In A Tesla Model S - Houston Chronicle http://t.co/iOZPxrx3sa
Am thinking of doing a movie "sequel" of sorts to Thank You for Smoking. That was bad CO2 for indiv, this for the planet
Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change http://t.co/C6H8HrzS8X
Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone.
Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy
Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere.
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
@kn0xvi11ain Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round http://t.co/V3XIcob4s8
Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety
@1stHubbleFan @keithwarren Exactly
In reality, 97% of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change http://t.co/soQCnJB61B
Climate change deniers claim "scientists disagree", same rebuttal used by tobacco industry about lung cancer for decades
Good article on "Climate Change" vs "Global Warming" referred by @ForrestTanaka http://t.co/D1s4RJ0qus
Was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix.
Had a minor operation, so am in bed in meds. Probably shouldn't be tweeting :)
@CosmicRami Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension &amp; mega torque.
Technically, I "got rich" from Zip2 &amp; PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla &amp; SolarCity.
If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds.
@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt.
Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census.
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases.
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad.
Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (@CarbonFreeGirl), who lives in NC http://t.co/pvEmE5pEVN
@VarunG_ Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.
@karlbrauer Making rockets
@tonykatz Don't like having a zillion tweets in the log. Makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history.
@SapientCapital We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't.
And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?
Those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong http://t.co/S7fOIrly6B

@DanaBrunetti Well, you see, by making it go to 11, that makes it louder than loud :)
Supercharger announcement pushed to next week. Something else this week.
@bryanclarke physics + a broad range of engineering. Worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history.
@vicorly Yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the Model S
@malkosh we do
@itsokayyouknow Harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change
Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon &amp; Peter Rive &amp; their awesome team. I'm just a small part.
@SeanChin @RaimisJ Over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
@annabananastand It can do hands free right now. Being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add...
@enggirl Mostly water or coffee at home. When I'm out, will have Macallan neat or vodka with something.
@danielmarshal15 It can dig up almost anything.
@JasonPolstein Yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. Requires hardware unfortunately.
@grimmerkimmer @dpinsen Given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story http://t.co/LWr3GODxBG
@RaimisJ Tesla software knits together Google Voice, Slacker, Gracenote &amp; others and streams over 3G (will be LTE later)
@dpinsen People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don't know if true, but he sure behaves that way.
Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python.
Hold down voice button &amp; say "Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic". Model S can play almost any song via Internet.
@realbhuwan Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy.
There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
@HowardReiter Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
@mjasandoval Stay tuned
Just want to say thanks to customers &amp; investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you.
@westcoastbill Thanks Bill!
Am a fan of Larry, Sergey &amp; Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here
Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck
@rebel_sal exactly
Creating an autopilot for cars at Tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. Still a few years from production.
@DJFrustration Tested it myself this weekend and was working well. Some songs have licensing prohibiting direct request.
Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!
Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla http://t.co/MNUIWDxoXt
@bdcs Yup, it is super far. Moon is basically in our back yard relative to Mars.
@nirdthebird Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places.
@DetlefKroeze Yeah, that probably makes sense.
@DouglasBullard @teslamotors Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time.
@flyguynscc @teslamotors yes, that has been the goal from the beginning
@fink_justin It can definitely strain relationships, but I loved doing my first company with my brother
@WehbyJammin Earnings call next week, then Supercharger week after and then... the mystery announcement/demonstration :)
@TeslaTrip you're welcome :)
@thebradholt we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
@Rocco_TheStreet Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good?
@ChrisCowan_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system.
Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
@stoneymonster Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners.
@yatpay Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
@pataneous We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway.
@2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
@rebel_sal Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better.
@Alan_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy
@darma_setia More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
@JSONberland We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
@BigBalli High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
F9R (pronounced F-niner) shows a little leg. Design is a nested, telescoping piston w A frame. http://t.co/H49TSS2CYl

Simulations show launch ok with bad valve. Still, better to stop &amp; fix. Recalling rockets after launch is not an option.
Launch aborted: slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine 5. Will adjust limits for countdown in a few days.
Whatever happens today, we could not have done it without @NASA, but errors are ours alone and me most of all.
