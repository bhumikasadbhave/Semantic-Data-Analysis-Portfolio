Matilde decides to discover the identity of the murderer of Marco via a medium woman. Nicole, an ambitious journalist she is, is just as eager to resolve the mystery of the murder. However, her initial investigations, of which she quietly holds the informed Surintendent Avanzo, comes up against a dead end: the owner of the intelligent nightclub Milena Bolzoni, the "official" mistress of the dead, has an alibi. The same evening, Nicole, who thinks her daughter is at the Conservatoire, is preparing for Sandra's birthday. However, when the latter's friend, Chiara, reveals with concern that Sandra did not stay at all with her in the previous night, as she had claimed, but rather planned to spend it with the industrialist who was murdered , the alarm ringtones are starting to go in Nicole's mind. She contacts the Superintendent Avanzo, who begins a research operation; He is unsuccessful. Nicole, now in the desperate strait, draws the consolation of the medium woman that Matilde, the mother of the dead man, had contacted earlier. Thanks to its special abilities, the medium succeeds in "finding" the young woman. The magic road leads Nicole near the mysterious villa. There she sees a body with motionless on a bank: she is her daughter, Sandra. Immersed by the tragedy that struck her, Nicole throws her arms around her daughter's corpse. Nicole's colleagues in Rome are starting to wonder why they heard nothing from her, and they send the experienced journalist Andrea Barei to Lucca to give them an update on the events. He soon discovered more details on the two murders of the Superintendent Avanzo; The two seem to be connected because the two victims were shot dead with the same pistol. The divorced husband of Nicole, Roberto, who left her and their daughter, years in advance, presents himself to the funeral of Sandra. Nicole, in a sort of lethargic trance, is hardly aware of the presence of her ex-husband. A few days later, however, she cannot avoid a painful confrontation with him about their past. When Roberto leaves, Nicole, lonely and completely distraught, made a suicide attempt. Fortunately, he fails. By recovering in the hospital, she hears from her friend Anna that because of the sensational nature of the murder affair, her daughter has become the target of several slanderous rumors in the press. Now Nicole again has an objective in life: she must save the reputation of her deceased daughter. This fills her with new forces. She decides to take the hazardous hunt for Sandra's killer on her own. From her superintendent friend Avanzo, Nicole learns the identity of several suspects who could have committed crime for reasons of jealousy: Milena, the official teacher of Marco; his wife, Daniela; Or Paolo, Sandra's ex-girlfriend. Meanwhile, violence strikes the normally peaceful streets of Lucca. Sandra's friend, Chiara, just avoids a mysterious attempt in her life one night. With the help of a medallion found at crime scene, Avanzo obtains an advance on who could be the culprit: Professor Carlo Mauri, teacher at the Conservatoire. It turns out that the latter is not a murderer, however, simply an inveterate voyeur. As a gratitude for his release, the professor reimburses the Superintendent with very useful information: he was the neighbor of Sandra, and the night of the murder, he saw his ex-little friend Paolo who was waiting for him before his nocturnal night -YOU; Then they both left together. When the Superintendent arrives, the resounding sirens and the flashing blue light, at Paolo, the suspect simply manages to escape his apartment before the police could arrest him ... Nicole learns of Avanzo that recent events have brought the Police to consider Paolo as the main suspect. Shortly after, she received a phone call from the young man: he protests against his innocence and explains that the reason he fled from the police was because he did not want to be wrongly identified as the murderer. Nicole, convinced of Paolo's innocence, continues with her only surveys. She discovers that her own friend, Anna, had in fact been the person who presented Sandra for the first time to the industrialist Marco. Nicole secretly shade her friend and grabs her by making a similar match. She takes Anna to the task and discovers that she is the mistress of Massimo Pierboni - the brother of the murdered man - for years now, and it was he who involved it in this lucrative, although immoral enterprise. An increasing number of apparently honest people in the city all begin to seem doubtful. The range of suspects widens more and more. Nicole discovers that Milena, the mistress of the murdered industrialist, and Martelli, her trading partner, carried out a fierce blackmail campaign. When events arrive at a deadly head and Milena was found dead in her nightclub, the police arrested Martlli as the main suspect. The Superintendent Avanzo, however, thinks that he knows who is the real murderer of Milena: the Shady Zappi, who was involved in all kinds of illicit relations with the director of the nightclub. Again, Nicole receives a warning from the Superintendent - who quietly considers her as a friend - on the growing danger of investigating herself. Without taking this warning into account, Nicole accepts Paolo's request to meet him in a secret place once he told him that he thought he was knowing who was the real murderer. She does not notice that Zappi observed her closely. Reunion is almost transformed into a drama in hostage: Nicole is seized by the killer Zappi, but Paolo comes with her help and succeeds in mastering her aggressor. When the police arrive at the scene, Paolo still has to escape before having the chance to tell Nicole who is suspected. Due to his involvement in Milena's death, Martelli is also one of the main suspects of the spectacular murders series. Nicole, however, doubts that he is guilty. And rightly, when it turns out that Daniela, the murdered man's wife, spent the night with Martelli the evening when the murder had taken place. But at this point, the murderer strikes again. One evening, Nicole is visited by the Medium woman, who, distraught, begs her to help Paolo: she feels that he is deadly in the villa where the murder took place. When the police arrive there, her prophecy turns out to be absolutely right: Nicole arrives too late to save Paolo's life. The Superintendent Avanzo intensifies the search for the real murderer and hears an art of Florentine that Massimo, the brother of the dead man, had secretly diverted the precious paintings of the villa of his parents. A few days before the murder of Marco, the latter had exhibited Massimo as a Filou. When Avanzo receives a very incriminating evidence of Severa, the family -cleaning lady, who once destroyed Massimo alibi, the Superintendent put Massimo arrest for alleged murder. However, everything is as it seems that Nicole's instincts tell him that her research is not yet over. Among Sandra's papers, she finds a letter, in which she discovers that the daughter of Severa, aged of Severa, the housekeeper of the family, died a few months earlier. The journalist feels that it was kept secret for reasons which are anything but harmless. She made a last attempt to reveal the mystery and follows Severa from the village of Braga, where the cleaning lady spent her free time with her son Michele. There, standing next to the grave of her daughter, Seve will make a terrible confession: she says that she was the person who murdered Marco. It was an act of revenge against the man who had seduced his pretty girl, then transformed it into drug addiction. Sandra, her daughter's successor, had surprised the cleaning lady shortly after the murder and she therefore had to be eliminated. Just like Paolo, who had started to suspect her a long time ago. Before Severa managed to kill Nicole, who is the only witness to this confession, her son Michele intervenes. He knew his mother's crimes, but had silence out of her love. Now he realizes that he is responsible for avoiding any other blood effort, and he informs the police. Finally, Nicole is able to close the most horrible chapter in her life. Before leaving the terrible city, she said goodbye with a heavy heart to the Superintendent Avanzo. Who knows what their friendship could have become in another place, at another, better moment ...

And it is right when it turns out that Daniela, the wife of the murdered man, spent the night with Martells in the evening that the murder took place. But at that moment the killer hits again. One evening, Nicole was visited by the woman Media, who, distracted, asks her to help Paolo: she feels that he is in a deadly danger in the villa where the murder happened. When the police arrive there, her prophecy turns out to be absolutely correct: Nicole arrives too late to save Paolo's life. The leader Abanzo strengthens the search for the true killer and hears from the Florentine Art Diller that Massimo, the dead man's brother, has secretly appropriated valuable paintings from his parents' villa. A few days before Marco's murder, the latter had exposed Massimo as a fraudster. When Abanza receives highly incriminating evidence from the North, the family housekeeper who destroys Massimo's alibi once and for all, Massimo's chief arrested a suspected murder. Not everything is as it seems ... Nicole's instincts tell her that her search is not over yet. Among Sandra's documents, she finds a letter in which she discovered that the seventeen -year -old daughter of the North, the family housekeeper died a few months earlier. The journalist feels that this is kept secret for reasons that are anything but harmless. She makes one last attempt to reveal the mystery and follows the North in the village of Braga, where the housekeeper spends her free time with her son Michele. There, standing at the grave of her daughter, the north makes a terrifying confession: she says she was the man who killed Marco. It was an act of revenge against the man who had seduced his beautiful daughter and then turned her into drug addressing. Sandra, the heir to her daughter, had surprised the housekeeper shortly after the murder, and so she also had to be eliminated. Like Paolo, who had begun to suspect her for a long time. Before the North manages to kill Nicole, who is the only witness to this confession, her son Michele intervenes. He knew about his mother's crimes, but he was silent from her love for her. He now realizes that it is his responsibility to avoid a further bloodshed and he informs the police. Finally, Nicole is able to close the most horrible head of her life.

He stands for a huge challenge to make this happen with the money he has to spend and the time he has to create to create such a unique party space. Like any great event, it starts with the theme. Put that wrong and Dylan's reputation will be in fragments. Dylan gets his inspiration for the huge event from ancient Rome. The party is called a dream of Mid Summer Night and is a tribute to the decadent past - Dylan wants to seduce his modern audience "to party as emperors." So he draws out of many of the shameful emperors from the past such as Nero and Caligula - but his favorite is a teenager called Elagabalus that is described by the Roman expert Julie Langford as 'The Greatest Partier The World once seen'. The strange youthful emperor is said to have fed his party guests ostrich brain and insects. Put tigers on his drunk friends, married a holy nun and drove through his palace in a chariot pulled by naked virgins. He also enjoyed orgies, the company of prostitutes and searched for men with the greatest organs in Rome. For Dylan Marter to make his modern male party guests feel that all the wish is a speed of the fingers, he has made a guest list with almost two women for every man. "We want extravagance, lots of alcohol, many beautiful women, enough of everything." But this event will not be a walk in the park for Dylan. His first major challenge is to bind the architecture together. The party will take place around two outdoor swimming pools, but a huge VIP lounge breaks out the entire area. "We always try to make a party that feels connected." So one of Dylan's first major decisions is how you can bring the design together, so that it looks like a great party space. Lighting, design and a lot of fog effect smoke will help to create the atmosphere that he is looking for. But the most important thing Dylan will trust is to enchant his male guests with what he calls 'living art' - beautiful girls whose naked bodies have been painted to look like bikinis. Because this event takes place in Sin City, it is thought that this will not be a problem. But there are some strange articles of association in Nevada and one of them will have a major impact on Dylan's plans. If he finds no solution on time, the authorities can close his entire party.

Dylan was invited to organize the biggest party event of the year at Palms Casino, with 3,500 demanding guests. He faces a massive challenge to get there with the money he has to spend and the time he must create such a unique party space. Like each major event, he starts with the theme. To be mistaken and the reputation of Dylan will be in tatters. Dylan attracts his inspiration for the immense event of ancient Rome. The party is called a dream of mid -summer night and is a tribute to the decadent past - Dylan wants to attract its modern audience "partying like emperors". Thus, he relies on many scandalous emperors of the past like Nero and Caligula - but his favorite is an out of control adolescent called Elagabalus who is described by the Roman expert Julie Langford as `` the greatest partial that the world has never seen ''. The strange juvenile emperor would have fed his guests at the ostrich party and insects. Put tigers on his drunk friends, married a sacred nun and rolled around her palate in a tank pulled by naked virgins. He also appreciated the orgies, the company of prostitutes and sought after men with the largest organs in Rome. To make Dylan Marers, to make his modern male festive guests feel as if their desire is a snap of fingers, he has created a guest list with nearly two women for each man. "We want extravagance, a lot of alcohol, a lot of beautiful women, a lot of everything." But this event will not be a walk in the park for Dylan. Its first big challenge is to link architecture together. The party will take place around two outdoor pools, but a huge VIP lounge breaks the whole area. "We always try to create a party that feels connected." So, one of the first big decisions of Dylan is how to bring together the design so that it looks like a large party space. Lighting, design and a lot of fog smoke will help create the atmosphere it is looking for. But the essentials on which Dylan will count is to bush his male guests with what he calls "living art" - beautiful girls whose bare bodies are painted to resemble bikini. Since this event takes place in Sin City, we imagine that it will not be a problem. But there are strange regulations in Nevada and one of them will have a great impact on the plans of Dylan. If he does not find a solution in time, the authorities can close all his party.
